Monitoring in real time the status and spread of the emergency makes decision making much faster and ship evacuations more organised.</p>","The three-year LYNCEUS project demonstrates how low-power wireless technologies can help localise and track people onboard ships, providing essential information in cases of evacuation, and improve overboard search and rescue. The technology can also be used to monitor the health of patients requesting to wear special bracelets, or help parents keep track of the location of children on large cruise ships, which can carry thousands of passengers and crew.

Their performance became comparable to silicon-based solar panels on the market. This result, published in 2011, has opened the door to other European research groups to further improve DSCs using 'perovskites' (a metal halide material with a crystal structure of the calcium titanium oxide mineral), pushing their efficiency to 20%.

Cooperatives are one application of servicizing, and there are many more. Project SPREE took up the challenge to see if servicizing could work by developing case studies for three business servicizing systems – crop protection management, car and bike sharing, and grey water recycling and rain water harvesting systems. SPREE's economic simulations indicate these proposals would encourage servicizing in these sectors – and be better for the environment, while boosting growth and competitiveness. The proposals are being disseminated at conferences and workshops, and in reports to policymakers across Europe.

Component 5 includes also heavily flooded Obrenovac.</p>","1. Access to basic rights - the project provides legal aid and supports Roma to obtain personal documents, register for health, education and social services, and access their rights as citizens. More than 969 administrative and court procedures were initiated, and 469 solved in 20 pilot municipalities/towns.
2. Establishment of mobile teams – the mobile teams for Roma inclusion in 20 pilot towns/municipalities consist of Roma municipal coordinators, pedagogical assistants, health mediators, as well as representatives from the Centres for Social Work and the National Employment Service. Mobile teams have been trained and are working in the field – they have helped around 600 children enrol in preschool. Some 2 822 participants took part in training in non-discrimination for local service providers (social and health).
3. Empowerment of civil society organisations - following the mapping of Roma civil society organisations, as well as organisations focused on Roma integration, 30 organisations and 4 networks participated in three rounds of training. Civil society organisations will receive mentorship assistance, as well as support for their active participation in the development and implementation of local policies for Roma.
4. Drop-out prevention programs in schools - the project provides assistance in establishing and implementing secondary school drop-out programme, by providing 1 000 monthly scholarships to Roma students (throughout two school years), as well as mentoring and peer support. The certification of 178 pedagogical assistants and 200 mentors is also among project results.
5. Improving housing conditions - the results of a detailed analysis of 58 substandard Roma settlements (in 20 pilot municipalities, as well as in Obrenovac) will be used to create a list of priorities for the development of infrastructure projects. Urban plans will be developed for 13 substandard settlements in 11 municipalities. The Study on 18 housing models for Roma so far used in Serbia was published, and municipalities have chosen the preferred models for their territory. Support to the Ministry of Construction, Transport and Infrastructure includes the mapping of 583 sub-standard Roma settlements in Serbia and the establishment of a geographic information system that will enable the monitoring and improvement of housing conditions.
6. Sustainable employment - 18 companies with the potential to sustainably employ Roma are provided equipment, mentoring and training, so as to employ around 60 Roma.","The Mission to Serbia of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), Serbia","Office for Human and Minority Rights, the Govt. of Serbia (Min. of Construction, Transport and Infrastructure; Education; Health; Labour & Social Policy), National Employment Service, Roma National Council, Govt.

More than 15 000 people have participated in the project's activities (e.g. various contest, project events). More than 6 000 items of information material (posters, books, leaflets, brochures) were produced and disseminated. A mobile application – game 'Ecokids' (http://ecokids.by/) was developed.The project brought immediate results in the form of pilot actions, which have been implemented in five parts of Minsk Oblast. They aimed at improving solid waste management and raising public awareness on the issue.A platform for communication on waste treatment issues has been created and now serves as a good national-level communication tool for all interested stakeholders.","IPO Ecopartnership, Belarus","Minsk Oblast Committee of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection, Belarus; REC Bulgaria, Bulgaria",Tolbuhina st. 2-20,,Minsk,BY,53.925981,27.6149738,,1356994800 to 1420066800,1356994800 to 1420066800,http://ecoproject.by/en/waste-management/projects/item/razrabotka,,Global Europe,Other EU as a global player actions & programmes,European Neighbourhood Policy and Enlargement Negotiations,EU as a Global Actor,270000,300233,DG NEAR,English

925,,Moldova Energy and Biomass Project,MEBP I and MEBP II,,"<p>This project aims to contribute to a more secure and sustainable energy production in Moldova through targeted support to renewable energy in form of biomass from agricultural waste. The idea is to increase the use of renewable energy sources, thus contributing to a more secure, competitive and sustainable energy production, as well as to local development. The target communities will produce their own energy, which will help creating new businesses and jobs, in addition to protecting the environment for future generations.</p>","During the first phase (2011-2014) the project yielded the following results:Biomas-fired heating systems were installed in 144 public institutions in rural communities, including 86 schools, 49 kindergartens, four community centers, three Mayor's Offices and two vocational schools. The number of beneficiaries of new biomass-based heating systems and improved thermal comfort is almost 26 835 children, 4 761 employees and 58 793 parents. The overall number of beneficiaries is 90 389 people.The project engaged 5 000 community inhabitants who participated in the identification stage. As a result, the MEBP project and local working committees mobilized over MDL 28 million in public and private contributions from local beneficiaries.The activities of the MEBP led to the creation of more than 350 new jobs. In most cases the new jobs were established for heating plant operators and solid biofuel producers.The MEBP project has also participated in developing national standards and regulations to support the local biofuel industry. To date, 37 national standards governing the production and quality of biofuels have been approved by the Government. The large number of bioenergy consuming institutions has encouraged the launch of biomass fuel producers.35 businesses were launched and promoted in the sector of solid biofuel manufacturing; 100 new jobs were created; 620 families have biomass boilers installed; 30 companies assemble biomass boilers locally and sell them to consumers; 21 public institutions from Leova District are heated with biomass based energy, the power being supplied by an economic entity within one of the first energy oriented PPPs; 15 thousand tones of C02 emissions being reduced annually.Each stage of the project implementation was accompanied by a complex agenda of trainings, which ensured a proper functioning of implemented initiatives and their sustainability. Approximately 1 765 LPA representatives including 1 253 women, gained practical skills on local contribution collection; 2 819 mayors and managers of public institutions know how to use and to multiply eco-technologies; 376 operators from 127 communities learned how to operated the biomass-based heating systems; 413 agricultural entrepreneurs know how to transform the waste into an economic product; 352 schools became part of the educational initiative on RES and energy efficiency; 19 000 pupils participated in the course on renewables and energy efficiency; 271 children participated in the Energel Summer Camp.The MEBP started its communication activity from a clean slate. The mandate of the project was not only to inform people about biomass energy and project activities, but also to change the attitude of a country with relatively conservative thinking in the area of renewable fuels.In the result of the project activities: 1 million people covered by communication on the Energy and Biomass Project; 12 video and sports videography promoting biomass energy broadcasted on TV, radio and online communication networks; 50 000 brochures, booklets and posters about benefits of bioenergy distributed thoughout the country; 2 000 reports in TV and radio, newspapers and web pages; three editions of the Moldova Eco-Energetica Competition organised; 180 projects enlisted for the competition; 48 successful projects granted awards at the Gala of Awards Moldova Eco-Energetica.; www.biomas.md - an unique communication platform in the bioenergy sector of the Republic of Moldova - was created.",United Nations Development Programme (UNDP),"Ministry of Economy, Energy Efficiency Agency, Energy Eficiency Fund, Ministry of Education...",,,,,47.0958696,28.8240969,,1293836400 to 1483225200,1293836400 to 1483225200,http://www.biomasa.md,,Global Europe,European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI),European Neighbourhood Policy and Enlargement Negotiations,EU as a Global Actor,23410000,23970000,DG NEAR,English

At the same time, it has forged partnerships and regional cooperation. It believes that the creative and innovative entrepreneurs of tomorrow are in schools today. To achieve this, it has been promoting changes in curricula, teacher training, and school management, and building closer links between education and the world of work.SEECEL's activities have widened since its launch. It now encourages innovation through its contacts at regional level, and with governments, the private sector, and civil society groups. It builds alliances and networks among the countries involved and creates partnerships with the world of enterprise in the European Union and beyond.The approach recognises that entrepreneurship means more than just encouraging people to become self-employed. It sees entrepreneurship as a vital factor in job-creation and competitiveness.

In the Western Balkans, countries need to build the appropriate structures and experience to investigate and prosecute complex criminal groups in an international context.

They focus on cases with cross-border implications, and aim to dismantle criminal organisations involved in illicit trafficking destined to the EU, in particular trafficking of firearms, drugs and human beings.The results of the first phase include:The creation of Joint Working Groups Prosecutors and policemen from EU Member States are seconded to the region in order to provide their counterparts with ongoing advisory services, with a focus on investigating and prosecuting cross-border cases of organised crime. They co-operate in 'Joint Working Groups' and are focusing on ongoing and upcoming investigations in the region. In this they will benefit from each other's contacts, information sources, tools and instruments. This will not only facilitate the work within the countries, but in particular between the countries and with EU Member States. Likewise, they will involve other projects funded from the 'Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance', like the regional 'Witness Protection Programme' but also national projects aimed at fighting crime.Access to International NetworksEuropol and Eurojust (including the European Judiciary Network in Criminal Matters) are closely associated to the projects, while Interpol is a partner in the 'Police project'. All beneficiary countries are already linked up to Europol via the secure information exchange system SIENA used by international law enforcement coordination offices, and police liaison officers of foreign countries in the region. These sources will be used to strengthen the investigations so that the prosecution can assure a successful follow-up after the arrest of criminals.

The metro system, which currently consists of three connecting lines, has, over the last two decades, helped to transform the city's transport by reducing traffic congestion, reducing smog levels and cutting journey times. The extensions of lines 2 and 3 contribute further to improved journey times and the creation of jobs during a period of economic contraction for the Greek economy.</p>","In total, the improvements will lead to the building of 14 new stations, of which three were completed and became operational in 2009/10. Metro line 3 (the airport line) will be extended south-westwards with the building of seven new stations between the current western terminus of Egaleo and a planned new terminus at Piraeus (expected to be completed in 2017). The 9 km extension will provide a rapid transport link between the airport (which lies east of the city), the city centre and the port of Piraeus to the south-west. Metro line 3 has already been improved by the building of three new stations (Holargos, Nomismatokopeio and Agia Paraskevi stations) on a pre-existing section of railway track between the centre of town and the airport.Line 2 will be extended by 5.5 km, from the current southern terminus at Agios Dimitrios to a new terminus at Helleniko (the site of the old airport). Between Agios and Helleniko three new stations will be constructed and are scheduled to become operational in 2013. Other improvements to the transport network include the building of bus/metro interchanges at Haidari, Nomismatokopeio and Kerameikos.Over the entire lifetime of the improvement projects, it had been estimated that the new metro system would help create 15 300 jobs. In the long-term, direct employment would result in the creation of over 1 500 permanent jobs once the extensions are operational. The extended metro system would also lead to around 9 million fewer vehicle trips being made in the Athens area per year.

But the ability for the emergency services to talk to each other prior to decisions being taken increased the response efficiency and reduced thus the redundancy in dispatched vehicles.  ",Regionální rada regionu soudržnosti Moravskoslezsko Úřad Regionální rady (Moravian-Silesian Regional Authority),Moravskoslezský kraj - Krajský úřad,"Moravskoslezský kraj - Krajský úřad, 28. října 117",702 18,Ostrava-Moravská Ostrava,CZ,49.8295741,18.2705604,,1199142000 to 1325372400,1199142000 to 1325372400,,"<a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/projects/czech-republic/new-combined-safety-centre-for-all-emergency-services-speeds-up-accident-response-times"">INFOREGIO project details</a>","Smart and Inclusive Growth: Economic, social and territorial cohesion",European Structural and Investment Funds,Research & innovation,"Jobs, Growth and Investment",22151337,27253735,DG REGIO,English

In addition, much less material was required to arrive at the same functionality, which has resulted in a more sustainable use of resources. Advances under ORGANEXT have been so impressive that experts are now predicting that the project could lead to the development of the next generation of solar cells.The results speak for themselves. Under ORGANEXT, more than 43 companies have set up product development and testing trajectories, while 1 670 individuals have been directly involved in cross-border cooperation projects. 76 initiatives to educate and inform business partners on the economic and ecological possibilities have been carried out, and overall, some 663 people have been trained, surpassing the original target of 270.Information about the project's impact has also been disseminated to a wide audience; for example, its results have been published in a total of 52 academic publications. These results all point to ORGANEXT having the potential to position Europe at the forefront of an important segment of the bio-economy.

Of the total 2 231 placements made by 2012, 75% were full-time positions and the remaining 25% were part-time. Over half of the workers placed in part-time jobs were able to work towards further qualifications in their remaining time.To date, 75% of the hired workers have received permanent contracts upon programme completion and 95% continue to work for the companies they were placed with. It is thought that a significant number of these skilled workers would not be employed without the help of the Einstiegszeit programme. It is also likely that many SMEs in Brandenburg would otherwise have faced a skilled-worker shortage, as most SMEs do not have the resources necessary for staff planning and development. The programme therefore helped to safeguard the future of the companies involved.Einstiegszeit has also contributed to a reduction in the brain drain effect experienced by Brandenburg in recent years, whereby qualified young people left the region because of an inability to find work.

3565,,Conservation of imperial eagle and saker falcon in key Natura 2000 sites in Bulgaria,BSPB LIFE+ SAVE THE RAPTORS,https://ec.europa.eu/budget/euprojects/sites/euprojects/files/life07_nat_bg_0000689_0.jpg,"<p>This project reversed the population decline of the imperial eagle in Natura 2000 network sites in Bulgaria. Key actions involved insulating 49 km of power lines, a major cause of raptor mortality, installing artificial nests and increasing the population of the prey species, the European souslik, a type of ground squirrel. The number of breeding pairs of imperial eagles increased from 16 to 25 and there has been a 30% increase in breeding success.</p>","The beneficiary was not able to find active nests of saker falcons, despite sightings of single birds and even pairs. This confirmed that the number of this species is critically low in Bulgaria. However, the project was able to significantly raise the breeding success of imperial eagles. Nine new breeding pairs formed during the project, bringing the national breeding population up to 25 breeding pairs. This represented a 20% increase in population size of the imperial eagle during the project lifetime and a 30% increase in the breeding success of imperial eagles. After the installation of 37 artificial nests for imperial eagles, three of these nests were occupied by newly-formed pairs.

Despite the project’s significant achievements in conservation imperial eagles, key threats to the birds prevail. The main threat identified for the raptor is electrocution by more than 5 000 un-insulated electricity poles that were mapped by the project. A priority list of those poles posing most danger was identified (i.e. those close to imperial eagles' nests) and these were targeted by the project. Some 595 electricity network poles (49 km of power lines) were then insulated, which is almost three times the original target of 200. This work was completed within the planned budget and outcomes entirely eliminated the threat of electrocution in nesting territories of seven pairs of imperial eagles.

Land acquisition followed by active management changes led to 61.60 ha of pastureland supporting colonies of the prey species European souslik and 14.32 ha of riverside forest habitat for the birds were also protected using similar methods. In addition, a new agri-environment measure supporting the imperial eagle was produced for Bulgaria’s Rural Development Programme, which will allow the restoration of over 240 ha of pastureland. Further land management inputs saw project results securing 200 ha of traditionally-managed pastures being grazed by sheep. Such actions are beneficial for both imperial eagles and saker falcons.

New knowledge was gained from satellite telemetry about the imperial eagles’ migration routes, wintering grounds and main threats for the Bulgarian population. This crucial information will be used on domestic and international level to define measures needed for the species’ long-term conservation.

Other project success factors included good cooperation that was established with the electricity company EVN. This led to the preparation of a proposal for continuation of the project activities through LIFE12 NAT/BG/000572 (LIFE for Safe Grid) that started in 2013. Outputs from the follow-up work will insulate dangerous electricity infrastructure in South-eastern Bulgaria, where the main imperial eagles' population is located.

The project had also had a positive socio-economic effect in terms of providing jobs and hiring local people in a region with the highest unemployment in Bulgaria.","Bulgarian Society for the Protection of Birds/ BirdLife Bulgaria, Bulgaria","Royal Society for the Protection of Birds/BirdLife, United Kingdom; MME/BirdLife, Hungary; Central Balkan National Park, Bulgaria; Fund for Wild Flora and Fauna, Bulgaria",Yavorov Complex,1111,Sofia,BG,42.738611,24.730556,,1230764400 to 1356994800,1230764400 to 1356994800,http://www.saveraptors.org,"<a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=3361"">Project summary</a>",Sustainable Growth: Natural Resources,LIFE+,Environment & climate,"Jobs, Growth and Investment;Energy Union and Climate",1534317,2045756,DG ENV,English
3566,,Restoration of habitats in the Federsee bog (ReHa Federseemoor),ReHa Federseemoor,https://ec.europa.eu/budget/euprojects/sites/euprojects/files/life07_nat_d_000233.jpg,"<p>This project re-wetted drained bog habitats in southern Germany, helping to sequester carbon and enabling the return of typical bog species. Key actions included turning a disused former airfield back into bog and establishing long-term management of the restored areas through grazing agreements with farmers. Raised water levels are helping to preserve Bronze Age archaeological finds in the peat layers from mineralisation. Collaboration between nature conservationists and archaeologists during the project contributed to the area becoming a UNESCO world heritage site in 2011.</p>","The project partners started dismantling the glider airfield in the middle of Federsee bog in the winter of 2009/2010. This included the removal of an aircraft hangar, restaurant, tower, fuel depot and tarmac driveways. The remaining gravel sites were covered with peat, while trees and shrubs were cleared. Birds are no longer disturbed by gliders and by 2014 the first typical wetland plants were reappearing. Since 2012, the site has been mown by a farmer and this management continues post-LIFE. The permit for rewetting this area was delayed due to nearby landowner objections, but it was finally gained two days before the end of the project (29 March 2014). The blocking of the ditches was done in April 2014, which included the construction of fish passes for Misgurnus fossilis. This newly rewetted area of about 15 ha includes a privately-owned area, bought decades ago by the Forschner family to protect Bronze Age archaeological finds. There are five central ditches (Bruckgraben) for the drainage of the southern Federsee bog. The project initially planned to block one ditch and redirect its water into another central ditch, though in the end this new connecting drainage ditch was not necessary. In early 2014, the ditch (no. 4 Bruckgraben) was just blocked at three places along 830 m, with its water running into the peatland. As Misgurnus fossilis might be affected, the blocking of the ditch was done in such a way to allow the fish to pass at times of high water levels. Overall, the action here resulted in an improved water regime on about 8 ha. A total of about 72 ha were rewetted by blocking 5 km of ditches. The project partners proposed to just rewet about 90 ha on both sides of the river Seekircher Ach in the northern Federsee bog, but succeeded in raising the water level in two rivers (by up to 0.8 m).By the end of the project, about 30 km of large and small ditches were closed completely and further ditches were blocked at 180 places. Two small rivers (Seekircher Ach and Brasenberger Bach) were reshaped from canalised waterways to near-natural meandering condition along about 2 km. Around 100 ha in this area was permanently rewetted and this will hopefully stop the process of peat soil loss (about 1-3 cm per year). Wetland bird species were quick to exploit improved habitat created by raised water levels. In October 2013, there were about 80 resting Gallinago gallinago and 15 Numenius arquata on site; both species had not been seen in this area for many years. In 2014, four pairs of lapwings (Vanellus vanellus) were breeding, for the first time in decades. A corncrake (Crex crex) was calling in May and ruffs (Philomachus pugnax) were recorded for the first time. At some sites (about 7.5 ha total), vegetation and the upper degraded peat soil layer was removed. Seeds from recorded plant communities in southern areas close to the Federsee were spread on most of these sites to initiate the growth of typical wetland habitat vegetation. Ongoing monitoring will identify the most suitable seed donor sites. Archaeologists and nature conservationists worked together during the project’s rewetting actions.Raised water levels are helping to preserve archaeological finds in peat layers from mineralisation. This work contributed to the area becoming an UNESCO World Heritage site in 2011. Nature conservation has gained from the archaeological findings, because the preservation of cultural heritage has made more stakeholders and local people accept large-scale rewetting measures. Moreover, the rewetting actions are an important contribution to the mitigation of climate change (carbon sequestration). Shrub was removed from a calcareous and alkaline fen site (1 ha). This led to increased numbers of targeted mollusc species (Vertigo angustior and Vertigo geyeri). Over the whole project area, invasive plants (e.g. Solidago canadensis and Impatiens glandulifera) were removed by mowing, mulching, eradication, cutting and coverage with dark foil. The project partners conducted an extensive public awareness campaign, through guided tours, information boards, an informative website, a monthly newsletter and other dissemination materials. An observation platform was constructed in the northern part of the area with LIFE funding, which gives good views and lessens visitor impact on the ground.","Regierungspräsidium Tübingen, Germany","NABU-Naturschutzzentrum Federsee Bad Buchau, Germany",Konrad-Adenauer-Str. 20,72072,Tübingen,DE,48.50332,9.049385,,1230764400 to 1325372400,1230764400 to 1325372400,http://www.nabu-federsee.de,"<a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=3335"">Project summary</a>",Sustainable Growth: Natural Resources,LIFE+,Environment & climate,"Jobs, Growth and Investment;Energy Union and Climate",652480,1304960,DG ENV,English
3567,,Actions for the conservation of coastal dunes with Juniperus spp. in Crete and the South Aegean,JUNICOAST,https://ec.europa.eu/budget/euprojects/sites/euprojects/files/life07_nat_gr_000296_20090229_040.jpg,<p>Coastal dune habitats with juniper species have been disappearing from Crete and elsewhere in the South Aegean region of Greece. This LIFE project introduced a package of coordinated conservation measures that applied integrated partnership principles to tackle tourism pressures and assist natural regeneration of this priority habitat.</p>,"The JUNICOAST project achieved the following results:239.31 ha of coastal dunes with Juniperus spp. have been demarcated in Crete and 327 wooden sticks have been installed for habitat demarcation;30 rubbish bins have been installed and all Cretan habitats have been cleared of litter;340 m of wooden boardwalks have been constructed and installed;113 directional sticks have been installed along 4.5 km of main trails;200 m of sand trapping fences have been constructed;16 information signs have been installed;184 juvenile Juniperus macrocarpa and other keystone species have been planted;Twelve naturally established juveniles of Juniperus macrocarpa have been fenced;Thousands of seeds from Juniperus macrocarpa and other 30 keystone species have been collected, cleaned and stored at the seed bank of MAICh;134 individuals of invasive species of Pinus brutia have been removed from all Cretan sites.The JUNICOAST project conducted the first in-depth description and characterisation of the habitat 'Coastal dunes with Juniperus spp.' in four Cretan Natura 2000 sites. It also implemented the first concrete conservation and dissemination actions in the context of a specific geographic area. The conservation actions at all four sites included habitat demarcation, waste removal, enhancement of juniper regeneration, and the restoration of the floristic composition and structure of the target habitat.The knowledge base of the habitat was significantly increased, in particular regarding the geomorphology of coastal dunes in Crete, the dune system plant communities and Juniperus population composition and structure, and the effects of anthropogenic threats on the ecological conditions of the habitat. Conservation and monitoring methods were developed, and promoted through habitat protection and restoration guidelines and monitoring protocols. Preparatory actions included the documentation of landform and land degradation processes in dune systems. Coastal dunes with Juniperus spp. were mapped for all Cretan sites. Stakeholder consultation determined the awareness of the value of the habitat and the threats to its survival. Governance structure and legal status of this protected habitat were also researched. The project implemented a number of botanical and infrastructure interventions designed to protect, improve and restore the habitat, including the restoration of dunes. Seeds of Juniperus macrocarpa and all the other keystone species were collected and used to reseed degraded areas. This resulted in enhanced regeneration of Juniperus spp. in key areas, and the restoration of the characteristic floristic composition and structure of the target habitat. Ex situ conservation and propagation of juniper species, the keystone and indicator species of the habitat, ensured that the plant communities can be replanted in the future.Local communities benefit financially from the presence of the 'coastal dunes with Juniperus spp.' habitat, through recreational activities such as camping. The project's communication strategy therefore highlighted that the economic well-being of the local communities depends to a large extent on the conservation and sustainable management of the coastal dunes. An assessment of tourist activities and visitor impact was made from surveys, personal interviews and on-site inspections. Threats from human activities were identified and minimised at all habitat sites. In particular, the project directly addressed the conflict between free-campers and nature conservation. Dunes were stabilised using vegetation and by the installation of wooden sand-trapping fences. Habitat demarcation and information signage, wooden boardwalks and path delineation, benches, tables and waste bins were put in place to reduce the impact of visitors. The communication and public awareness campaign targeted the general public, tour operators, local stakeholders, government officials, school children and the scientific community. Dissemination activities included a project website and the use of social media, leaflets and teaching guidelines, an information film, and T-shirts.The public awareness and dissemination actions also promoted the conservation of the habitat at other sites in the South Aegean, by providing training on the methods implemented in Crete. The wider conservation community was made aware of this particular habitat, the threats to its survival, conservation issues and future monitoring needs. Long-term monitoring protocols for the target habitat were established. The quantifiable indicators included number of Juniperus broken branches, percentage ground cover, number of Juniperus spp. seedlings, percentage exposure of Juniperus spp. roots, total number of plant species, and the presence of invasive species. The project provided support for better environmental governance in Natura 2000 sites through stakeholder involvement and training. Networking with other LIFE projects dealing with coastal dunes and/or juniper species enhanced the exchange of know-how and best practices. The long term sustainability of the project results will be ensured through the creation of European, national and local networks, as well as through the after-LIFE conservation and communication plans. These will ensure the continual updating of the habitat knowledge base, the maintenance of infrastructure and litter removal to minimise visitor impacts, in situ and ex situ conservation activities, monitoring of the threats to plant species and the deployment of wardens for fire protection.","Mediterranean Agronomic Institute of Chania, Greece","National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (NKUA) - Faculty of Biology - Dept of Botany, Greece; Decentralised Administration of Crete - Forest Directorate of Chania - Forest Directorate of Lasithi - Regional Development Fund of Crete, Greece",Alsylio Agrokipiou 85,73100,Chania,EL,34.823333,24.085,,1230764400 to 1325372400,1230764400 to 1325372400,http://www.junicoast.gr,"<a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=3348"">Project summary</a>",Sustainable Growth: Natural Resources,LIFE+,Environment & climate,"Jobs, Growth and Investment;Energy Union and Climate",1125908,1501210,DG ENV,English
3568,,Conservation of Hungarian meadow viper (Vipera ursinii rakosiensis) in the Carpathian-basin,CONVIPURSRAK,https://ec.europa.eu/budget/euprojects/sites/euprojects/files/life07_nat_h_000322.jpg,<p>The Hungarian meadow viper is Hungary’s most-endangered vertebrate - fewer than 500 individuals of this sub-species remain. This LIFE project increased the area of the vipers’ favoured grassland habitat by more than 400 ha and reintroduced several hundred vipers bred in captivity. The beneficiary also worked closely with local communities to better promote coexistence with the snakes.</p>,"The CONVIPURSRAK LIFE project succeeded in increasing the population size of the critically endangered Hungarian meadow viper. The beneficiaries significantly increased the area of continuous viper habitat by almost 400 ha, including the purchase of more than 80 ha of land that is now under the control of National Park administrations in Hanság and Kiskunság. This land is suitable for the long-term sustainable management of extensive grassland that is favourable for the viper species. Grassland reconstruction activities included the removal of invasive plant species (e.g. common milkweed and tree of heaven) and a reduction in the area covered by tree plantations, with grass being reseeded in cleared areas. In total, habitat reconstruction increased the area of continuous potential viper habitat to over 1 600 ha in Hanság. In Kiskunság National Park (KNP), important land was purchased within a core viper population area (upper Peszéradacs meadows), which is extensively grazed by livestock. These areas are protected areas at national level and are included in the Natura 2000 network. Management plans have been drawn up, for example, with regulations prohibiting machinery and the use of fertilisers, and obliging tenant farmers to use extensive grazing methods. The technology used by the farmers on this land is not only compatible with the conservation of wildlife, but can also be profitable for the farmers through the sale of ‘bio-quality products’.The project moved forward the captive breeding programme for Hungarian meadow viper, which was launched by the previous viper LIFE project (LIFE04 NAT/HU/000116). Innovative aspects introduced to the programme by the new LIFE project included the design and production of artificial burrows. In total, 242 vipers were successfully reintroduced into their natural habitats at three sites (two in Kiskunság and one in Hanság). Valuable information about the behaviour of the reintroduced vipers was obtained through radio-tag monitoring, using a methodology using innovative radiotelemetry tags developed by the project team. The project also made improvements to measuring, sampling and specific genetic marker techniques for vipers. Altogether, 43 released individuals were identified among 204 vipers detected. Despite fewer vipers being released than the 400 foreseen, the results from the monitoring proved the viability of the released vipers.Infrastructure building during the project included the renovation of the Hungarian Meadow Viper Conservation and Exhibition Centre, which first built in 2004 and is operated by MME BirdLife Hungary and the KNP. With the construction of new education facilities, it was opened to the public for the first time. A prey breeding centre was also established in Budapest Zoo. These actions formed part of one of the project’s most important goals: to raise public awareness about the endangered viper. The beneficiaries informed thousands of people in Hungary and in Austria about the project and the species, for example, through ongoing viper exhibitions in Budapest Zoo and Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna. A 25-minute documentary film (‘Aristocrat of Snakes’) was produced, along with a 52-minute nature movie (‘Vipera Life’) and a series of short films, to increase understanding about the species among a general audience.The project produced numerous dissemination products and organised hundreds of events, including the project website and social media feeds, several publications, information boards and a mobile exhibition. Successful national and international cooperation between the project and NGOs, public bodies and scientific institutes helped create positive attitudes toward the project and its objective of conserving the Hungarian meadow viper. This was confirmed through attitude surveys that assessed the effectiveness of the publicity campaign. The extensive management that is favoured by Hungarian meadow viper is also the key to the conservation for many other protected species and habitats. The viper occurs in grasslands formed by a mosaic of drying marsh-meadows and sandy pastures, where the relatively diverse features of terrain and grass cover provide high prey-abundance and several different microclimatic options. Therefore, through the reconstruction of such grasslands, the viper can be regarded as an umbrella species for the conservation of local wildlife.","Magyar Madártani és Természetvédelmi Egyesület, Hungary","Kiskunság National Park, Hungary; Fertő-Hanság National Park, Hungary; Nationalpark Neusiedler See-Seewinkel, Austria; Budapest Zoo, Hungary; Schönbrunn Zoo, Austria; Compound Eye Film Ltd., United Kingdom; Research Institute of Wildlife Ecology, Austria",Költö u. 21,1121,Budapest,HU,47.761944,17.298333,,1230764400 to 1356994800,1230764400 to 1356994800,http://www.rakosivipera.hu,"<a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=3364"">Project summary</a>",Sustainable Growth: Natural Resources,LIFE+,Environment & climate,"Jobs, Growth and Investment;Energy Union and Climate",1669967,2260886,DG ENV,English
3569,,Project for Optimisation of Water and Emissions Reduction,POWER,https://ec.europa.eu/budget/euprojects/sites/euprojects/files/life08_env_e_000114.jpg,"<p>The POWER project showed how the energy and water efficiency of irrigation can be improved by defining two good water governance models, one for agriculture and the other one for irrigation in urban green areas. These models, which were demonstrated in the Zaragoza region of Spain, included the re-use of water and the use of solar-thermal power, micro-wind and biomass energy to pump water.</p>","The POWER project represented a qualitative and quantitative step forward with respect to the previous LIFE OPTIMIZAGUA project, which focused exclusively on efficient water management. In addition to furthering water efficiency, the POWER project introduced a second component to make energy savings on the moving of water sprinklers for irrigation. The project moved toward its goals by defining two 'good water governance' models. The first was a model for agriculture, with the aim of improving crop irrigation efficiency. This action was managed by the associated beneficiary Montesnegros Irrigation Community (Comunidad de Regantes Montesnegros) in La Almolda, Bujaraloz (Zaragoza). The project team selected a small (1 ha) plot of corn within this farmland area to experiment with and demonstrate water-efficient sprinkler irrigation, and a larger (3 ha) pilot corn plot for a drip irrigation system. The second model was for irrigation in urban green areas.Actions aimed at improving the efficiency of irrigation and water use in cities and towns were led by the Aragonese Agri-Environmental Management Company (Sociedad Aragone­sa de Gestión Agroambiental - SARGA), at the Municipal Sports Centre in Calatayud (Zaragoza). The project validated both 'good water governance' models, which combined principles of water and energy efficiency with applications based on renewable energy for the eco-management of water. The methods included water re-use and the utilisation of solar-thermal power, micro-wind and biomass energy to pump water. Water savings obtained represented an 86% overall improvement in terms of water consumption and 46% savings by 'irrigation efficiency'. The results recorded 83 262 m3 of 'recovered water' for irrigation, 233 640 m3 of water loss avoided in due to faults (e.g. leaks), and a 7% improvement of 'drip corn productivity'. Energy savings arising from irrigation water movement were calculated in terms of around a 74% overall improvement in 'energy efficiency' (85% improvement in agriculture and 59% in urban green spaces). Fossil fuel savings in energy generation of over 60% in urban green areas amounted to an accumulated equivalent of 100 tonne of oil equivalent (toe) per year. Reductions of more than 200 tons of GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions were calculated, as a consequence of the experimental implementation of the two models.The project identified 135 sites in Spain and in Turin (Italy), where its findings could be replicated. These were incorporated in a GIS database, along with calculated carbon dioxide emission reduction potentials that totalled over 12 000 CO2 tonnes/year. This information is available on the project website (www.lifepowerproject.eu), along with a publically-available 'Stop CO2' calculator and information on other project outcomes. Key to the POWER project's success was its dissemination strategy, via media, its documentary film and website, publications, international conference, meetings and events. This is reflected in the number of stakeholders taking up the initiatives developed in the project’s 'good water governance' models, including local authorities, technology-based companies and other private or public entities. These stakeholders committed to the objectives of reducing energy consumption and GHG emissions derived from irrigation tasks. A total of ten irrigation communities have adhered to the project, including the national association of irrigation communities, while 46 cities and towns have committed to making water and energy savings, and to reducing GHG emissions, by applying the techniques produced and tested in the project's models for efficient irrigation management in agriculture and urban green areas.","Fundación San Valero, Spain","Comunidad de Regantes Montes Negros, Spain; Environment Park SpA, Italy; Dirección General de Aguas del Gobierno de La Rioja, Spain; Asociación Aragonesa de Entidades Locales, Spain; Europa Innovación y Desarrollo SL, Spain","C/ Violeta Parra, 9",50015,Zaragoza,ES,41.65,-0.8833,,1262300400 to 1325372400,1262300400 to 1325372400,http://www.lifepowerproject.eu/,"<a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=3428"">Project summary</a>",Sustainable Growth: Natural Resources,LIFE+,Environment & climate,"Jobs, Growth and Investment;Energy Union and Climate",651213,1421327,DG ENV,English
3570,,"Zero emissions using renewable energies, hydrogen technologies and sustainable mobility",ZERO-HYTECHPARK,https://ec.europa.eu/budget/euprojects/sites/euprojects/files/life08_env_e_000136.jpg,"<p>The ZERO-HYTECHPARK project demonstrated a range of applications for the use of renewable hydrogen at the Walqa Technology Park in Spain. These included installing solar panels for heating and air conditioning, and using hydrogen fuel cells for powering vehicles and heating water. Using hydrogen was shown to be an effective way of reducing carbon dioxide emissions.</p>","The ZERO-HYTECHPARK used a number of applications to demonstrate that hydrogen technologies can reduce CO2 emissions. This was achieved through the validation of different types of hydrogen-fuelled energy options at the project site. These were:SOLAR THERMAL INSTALLATION - technology to feed the heating and air-conditioning system of the Aragon Hydrogen Foundation building. Use of this solar panel energy as a support to existing heating systems in the Foundation building provide emission reductions of up to 4 500 kg of CO2 per year.ISOLATED PHOTOVOLTAIC SOLAR INSTALLATION - responsible for powering office IT equipment in the Aragon Foundation building, thereby reducing CO2 emissions by 7 500 kg per year.HY TOW - an automated street cleaning system using a water tank with a pressure hose that allows easy cleaning of streets in urban areas. The fuel cell installed is responsible for powering the water pump and the electric motors responsible for moving the unit.FCEV - converting a vehicle by changing the electric battery to a hydrogen fuel cell. Results provide the car with greater autonomy (up to 50% more) and a reduction in the charging time (from periods of up to eight hours to a charge time of just 3-4 minutes). The electric motor is powered by electrical energy from the fuel cell, which in turn is fed by compressed hydrogen at 350 bars. The car also includes a system capable of retaining heat generated by the fuel cell, which can then be used to heat the car's interior. This has the advantage of reducing the car's total energy consumption.FORKLIFT - transforming a forklift truck by replacing the electric battery with a hydrogen-fed fuel cell. The main problems faced with a traditional electric battery are the long periods needed to recharge it and the lack of autonomy this leads to. In an average eight hours shift, an operator has to stop at least once to replace the spent battery with a charged battery, a process which can take between 15 and 30 minutes. With a hydrogen powered forklift, the recharge is almost immediate. The entire process takes approximately 2-3 minutes, and one charge is sufficient to complete a full eight hours shift.COGENERATION BATTERY - a fuel cell powered by hydrogen was set up as a cogeneration system (combined heat and power use) in a project prototype. The system offers 4 km of electrical power and 3.5 kW of thermal power, which heats water in a 150l tank from 20ºC to 60ºC over a period of two hours. The system yield is 70% - 40% electric, 30% thermal and 30% loss. Hot water can be used as Domestic Hot Water (DHW) or for heating. The main advantage of this system is that it does not produce pollutant emissions.FUEL CELL CONNECTED TO THE POWER GRID - hydrogen cells that reuse the surplus hydrogen from electricity production. Firstly, hydrogen is produced using the surplus of renewable energy generated. The hydrogen is stored in facilities and whenever a boost of extra electricity is needed, the hydrogen fuel cell is used to re-inject electricity into the grid.UPS - an uninterruptible power supply is a device that can supply short-term energy to all devices connected to it when a power cut occurs. The inclusion of a hydrogen fuel cell in an UPS allows the duration of back-up energy provision during a power cut to be increased exponentially. The duration can be days and even weeks compared to the few minutes or hours provided by a conventional system.Improvements in the current hydrogen station were also made by monitoring the main parameters and improving the communication system, as well as developing a system for compressing the gas produced in the foundation through the use of metal hydrides (via a COMURO system). The COMURO compresses hydrogen using thermal energy from a chemical reaction between the hydrogen and a metal alloy containing iron, lanthanum, nickel mixed with other elements. A pressure of 200 bars can be achieved in a single stage. An increase in pressure is possible by increasing the number of stages. In fact experimental systems already exist that can achieve pressure of up to 500 bars. A combination of all these energy applications was shown to reduce CO2 emissions in the Walqa Technology Park, using methods that comply with current legislative standards.Renewable energy installations currently in use in the Walqa Technology Park can now supply between 15% and 45% of the Park’s electricity demand (the difference in the figures is due to seasonal variations in consumption). A second energy evaluation investigated heat consumption, in both the Foundation building and the Technology Park as a whole. A detailed analysis of the energy balance of the Foundation building's solar thermal installation was included in the Zero-Hytechpark project. The result was a reduction of 19% in propane emissions, the energy source of the current heating system. A third energy evaluation studied CO2 emissions from employees' transport journeys to and from their homes to the Technology Park. This study covered Hydrogen Foundation employees as well as staff from other companies based in the Park. The study of the Foundation also included emissions generated by staff's work-related journeys. Key results for both applications found that 885Nm3of hydrogen would be needed each year to meet the demands of a fleet of vehicles. The surplus hydrogen could help produce around 1060kWh of thermal energy, which could be used by the solar thermal system to further reduce the consumption of propane fuel used in the Foundation building's heating system.It is expected that this project can act as a catalyst for new projects in other installations and other applications from these companies. The project will be a model for other buildings and installations in terms of demonstrating that it is possible to be more self-sufficient with renewable energies and hydrogen technologies. An important lesson learned is that projects dealing with very innovative technologies under continued development need to have a good monitoring of the technical advances made in the sector. Such projects also need to have a flexible design so that they easily can be adapted.","Fundación para el Desarrollo de Nuevas Tecnologías del Hidrógeno en Aragón, Spain","Andalusian Technology Park, Spain; Walqa Technology Park, Spain; Bilbao Technology Park, Spain","Parque Technológico WALQA, Ctra.

3571,,The LTER network as an integrated and shared system for ecosystem monitoring,EnvEurope,https://ec.europa.eu/budget/euprojects/sites/euprojects/files/life08_env_it_000399.jpg,"<p>Vast amounts of environmental data are being collected across Europe. However, much of this information is not readily comparable. The Italian-led 'EnvEurope' project worked across eleven countries to harmonise and improve the data-gathering and comparison procedures of the European Long-Term Ecosystem Research Network. It also developed a common set of key long-term ecological parameters and measurement protocols for use in the field and provided tools and recommendations for reporting and sharing datasets.</p>","The 'EnvEurope' project adopted a cross-domain approach, involving eleven LTER-Europe countries, 17 partners and 67 LTER sites (around 20% of LTER-Europe sites), including terrestrial sites, continental and transitional waters, and marine sites. The project addressed the following key issues:Development of a common set of key long-term ecological parameters and measurement protocols for use in the field.Collection of data in the field in a coordinated, site-based way.Management of information and datasets.Investigation of shared scientific hypotheses using case studies aiming at long-term data analysis.Network design aimed at producing better information about the key components of LTER-Europe (sites, datasets, people, etc.).'EnvEurope' provided solutions for harmonising LTER parameters, making parameters and methods available, managing LTER datasets, sharing and making accessible LTER datasets. It also addressed how LTER-Europe could detect ecosystem change and how it can be linked with Remote Sensing (Copernicus). It achieved this by establishing a conceptual framework that allows comparability and ranking of ecological parameters and data gained at LTER sites across Europe. It also tested the LTER network as a harmonised set of sites through field measurements of a broad spectrum of parameters and environmental quality indicators with common methodologies. The issue of gathering data in a structured way was also addressed, and the project helped manage and make available information ('metadata') about sites, persons and datasets across LTER-Europe.Another key achievement of the project was the definition and provision of tools and recommendations for LTER dataset reporting and sharing, and for integrated data management in the domain of long-term ecological research. Furthermore, the project investigated scientific hypotheses within the LTER community, through case studies aimed at long-term metadata and data analysis. These studies involved as many sites as possible. Finally, the project produced better information about the organisation of LTER-Europe to improve information flow and increase the visibility of LTER-Europe as a reference network for scientists, policy makers and environmental managers at the European level. 'EnvEurope' developed its input to SEIS. Special attention was given to the current 16 actions of the SEIS action plan and future actions with special focus on concrete metadata and data flows from the realms touched by 'EnvEurope'. Other activities contributed to Copernicus/GMES by establishing collaboration schemes between LTER-Europe and the remote sensing activities related to the environmental monitoring of Copernicus. Most efforts were devoted to understanding the opportunities of a two-way collaboration with Copernicus, as well as providing an assessment of in situ data usability and testing the applicability of large-scale remote sensing products for long-term ecosystem monitoring in Europe.Scope for further cooperation following 'EnvEurope 'was also sought: during the time frame of 'EnvEurope', most partners had established formal contacts and cooperation between the national LTER networks and Copernicus representatives in their own countries. The results of the 'EnvEurope' project have implications for SEIS, which is being promoted by the European Commission, as well as helping initiate collaboration schemes with Copernicus. The permanent LTER-Europe site network could represent a valuable system for in situ validation of satellite data, thus supporting the implementation of the Copernicus programme. At the end of the project, the LTER-Europe network is, as a result, more integrated, more active and has greater capacity to deliver and support vital research. The LIFE project represents, for LTER-Europe, the entry point for the next phase of designing the European research infrastructure landscape in the field of biodiversity and ecosystem research. LTER-Europe, with its highly instrumented observational sites and socio-ecological research platforms, is now ready to cooperate and interact with both large-scale monitoring schemes (including remote sensing) and experimental approaches, especially EU projects such as ExpEER (Distributed Infrastructure for Experimentation in Ecosystem Research) that are inspired by the metadata management and thesaurus work done in 'EnvEurope'. On the global level, the LTER network has decided to adopt EnvThes as the core vocabulary for the global LTER network.Moreover, LTER Europe could address the EU 2020 Biodiversity Strategy targets due to its history, structure, data and metadata. Also, 'EnvEurope' can provide common monitoring methods, harmonised parameters and ancillary datasets between Natura 2000 sites and LTER sites. It could also be relevant for the provision of data needed for reporting indicators for EU directives (e.g. Habitat or Bird directive, Kyoto Protocol, Water Framework Directive, Marine Strategy). Much of the network infrastructure of LTER is directly relevant to the Horizon 2020 challenges and related socio-economic goals. Several proposals responding to the first Horizon 2020 call will build on the potential analysed by 'EnvEurope' and contribute to the implementation of an operational infrastructure of distributed data hot spots covering major European environmental and socio-economic gradients in an exemplary way. The 'EnvEurope' project has substantially supported the trans-European team of experts in the fields of harmonisation and standardisation, information management (concepts as well as implementation) and network design, all of which are crucial specifically for the recent INFRAIA call in Horizon 2020.","Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR) Istituto di Scienze Marine (ISMAR), Italy","Helmotz-Centre For Environmental Research, Germany; Instytut Ekologii Terenów Uprzemysłowionych, Poland; Conecofor, Italy; Ministero delle Politiche Agricole, Corpo Forestale dello Stato, Italy; University Of Jyväskylä, Finland; [and other]",Castaello 1364/A,30122,Venezia,IT,45.4375,12.3358,,1262300400 to 1356994800,1262300400 to 1356994800,http://www.enveurope.eu,"<a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=3445"">Project summary</a>",Sustainable Growth: Natural Resources,LIFE+,Environment & climate,"Jobs, Growth and Investment;Energy Union and Climate",3003938,6067876,DG ENV,English
3572,,Widespread introduction of constructed wetlands for a wastewater treatment of Agro Pontino,REWETLAND,https://ec.europa.eu/budget/euprojects/sites/euprojects/files/life08_env_it_000406.jpg,"<p>The Pontine Plain is a vast area of former marshland, characterised by unplanned urban development and intensive agricultural practices, which have led to severe water pollution. This LIFE project demonstrated natural water purification and water management systems, and drafted an Environmental Regeneration Programme, incorporating widespread biofiltering techniques, in order to both reduce water pollution and increase biodiversity.</p>","The REWETLAND project worked to integrate specific sustainable water management objectives with more general environmental enhancement objectives. It did this through two main activities: the implementation of four pilot studies to demonstrate natural water purification and water management systems and the drafting of an Environmental Regeneration Programme (Action Plan). Preparatory research activities preceded these main actions and included studies into the environmental status of the Pontine Plain, feasibility studies for the pilot water purification systems, and the creation of basic GIS database layers. The large datasets and environmental studies created represent unique information that was previously unavailable in this area of the Lazio Region, which will inform future policy implementation. The four pilot actions involved the building of artificial or constructed wetlands and demonstrating water management techniques, in particular:A constructed wetland in the Circeo Natural Park, for purifying the waters coming from agricultural and urban sources, utilising reeds, rushes and other wetland plants, whose roots host bacterial colonies able to reduce pollutants (nutrients and pesticides).A linear park in the town of Marina di Latina, integrating purification functions with leisure activities.Natural buffer strips along the reclamation canals, providing functions of both water purification and erosion control;Testing and dissemination of good agricultural practices in a 150 ha wine farm (Casale del Giglio), comprising measures for controlling surface water runoff.The environmental reclamation activities were conducted using a strong participatory approach. The sharing of decisions with all stakeholders (e.g. institutions, public and private bodies, farmers and citizens), and inter-institutional collaborations for planning and implementing the interventions, were deemed fundamental to ensuring their effectiveness and for achieving sustainability goals. This successful methodological approach helped to create governance mechanisms involving all local and regional agencies relevant for the management of local water resources.The Environmental Regeneration Programme comprises an Action Plan, which defines the activities necessary for the achievement of its objectives, a set of guidelines for its implementation, and project sheets containing operational examples. It has undergone a Strategic Environmental Assessment procedure (SEA). The SEA process ensured the involvement of the regional authorities and, for this reason, the project outputs are likely to inform the new regional River Basin Management Plan. The Action Plan is the first of its kind in the Lazio Region. A wide participatory process accompanied its drafting, with numerous discussion meetings involving the public and local stakeholders, which raised awareness of the water management problems in the area. It also contains actions intended to achieve several long-term socio-economic benefits, particularly for the local farming sector. The Environmental Regeneration Programme and its accompanying guidelines provide a river restoration tool directly linked to the application of the Water Framework Directive (WFD). Dissemination actions were planned throughout the project to facilitate the achievement of the technical actions through the Environmental Regeneration Programme, often targeted at specific groups. Activities relating to the publically-accessible pilot areas included school and general guided visits.The project partners published a series of brochures and a book. All the dissemination actions were supported through the project website, social media, a GeoBlog and other channels. As the pilot interventions were only completed at the very end of the project, the monitoring of their efficacy will be part of the after-LIFE activities, with monitoring being an institutional task of the coordinating beneficiary, the Province of Latina. The methodology proposed by the project could be replicated in similar situations in Europe, for example, with non-point source pollution from agriculture in modified or artificial water bodies, particularly in the Mediterranean Basin. The project also saw the creation of jobs in the local context of Latina Province. In the project lifetime, ten temporary contracts were activated and 23 consultancy companies, suppliers and construction companies and 13 external experts. For the after-LIFE, the Province has hired one expert to ensure the harmonisation and homogenisation of the data collected within the project, making it suitable for policy makers. Moreover, experts in the monitoring of water quality parameters and in the maintenance of the pilot projects have been hired for maintaining the services for at least one year after the end of the project.","Provincia di Latina, Italy","Consorzio di bonifica dell’Agro Pontino, Italy; Parco Nazionale del Circeo, Italy; U-SPACE s.r.l.

3573,,Increase awareness to curb horticultural introductions of invasive plants in Belgium,AlterIAS,https://ec.europa.eu/budget/euprojects/sites/euprojects/files/life08_inf_b_000052.jpg,"<p>The AlterIAS project helped promote best practices for preventing the release and spread of invasive alien species in Belgium by drawing up a voluntary Code of Conduct in consultation with the horticultural sector, environmental authorities and the scientific community. The project’s approach was to try to stop the introduction of invasive alien species at source. By 2014 more than 200 garden centres had signed up to the Code of Conduct, agreeing to the withdrawal of 28 invasive alien species from sale.</p>","Firstly, the AlterIAS project assessed the socio-economic value of invasive plant species for the horticultural sector in Belgium, through an analysis of 146 catalogues in Flanders and Wallonia and a survey involving 67 nurserymen. The resulting report showed that 70% to 90% of the invasive plants listed by the Belgian Platform on Biodiversity were commercially available in nurseries. Of the 55 invasive species available in nurseries, 31 were on the Biodiversity Platform’s black list and 32 were considered of economic value, but 44% of the nurserymen considered that these invasive species represented less than 5% of their total sales. After ten months of negotiations, between the horticulture industry, authorities responsible for the environment and the scientific community, a voluntary Code of Conduct was agreed. This comprised five good practices: keeping informed about invasive plants in Belgium, stopping the selling and planting of certain invasive plants (the consensus list), disseminating information on invasive plants, promoting non-invasive plant alternatives, and participating in the early detection of new invasive plants. The Code of Conduct was proposed to horticulture professionals for subscription. Those subscribing could use a label designed to signify good practice in this area.At the end of the project, 1 027 partners (signatories) were involved in the Code of Conduct, including 243 nurserymen, 28 landscape architects, 52 garden contractors, 151 public green managers, six botanical gardens and 478 amateur gardeners. Nearly 200 garden centres and other selling points had adopted the Code of Conduct by 2014. All signatories were committed to withdrawing from sale or not planting the invasive plants on the agreed consensus list. The consensus list led to the withdrawal of 28 species from selling lists (more than 50% of the invasive species previously available in nurseries), including 20 terrestrial plants, eight aquatic plants, 20 black list plants and eight watch list plants identified by the Belgian Platform on Biodiversity. This represented around 44% of the total invasive plants listed for Belgium.To help fill the gap in the market left by the withdrawal of invasive plants, the AlterIAS project conducted research and produced a brochure promoting commercially-interesting alternative non-invasive plants. This brochure presented native plants according to similar ornamental function to withdrawn invasive species, such as shrub, border plant, green-screen, groundcover or climbing plants. The brochure proved especially popular with amateur gardeners. Two demonstration gardens were created with the help of landscape architects, including mixed borders with native plants. The extensive general awareness campaign, to promote the Code of Conduct and its good practices, included a 40-minutes film (500 copies on DVD), 60 000 project folders, articles in the press and horticultural magazines, TV and radio features, newsletters, a layman’s report, and stands at various horticultural events.The project organised specialist information sessions for horticulture teachers and two international workshops. The multi-lingual project website (www.alterias.be) has become an important resource for information on invasive plant species. By the start of 2014, the website had recorded around 68 000 visits. At the end of the project, the horticulture professionals surveyed were more aware of the ecological impacts of invasive plants: the proportion of respondents who spontaneously cited negative impact on biodiversity had increased by 17%. There was also a better knowledge of the list of invasive plants in Belgium (28 species correctly cited in 2013, compared to 17 in 2010). This increased awareness should also help nurserymen identify new invasive plants that establish in natural habitats, which are not on existing lists. These can be reported on a factsheet contained in the Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct represents a stronger and more effective voluntary tool than those adopted in other European countries. A key element of this is the subscription element, which is absent from other codes. This approach may be a first step toward increasing self-control within the horticulture sector. The AlterIAS approach to stopping the introduction of IAS (invasive alien species) at source is readily transferable, with the project being contacted by interested stakeholders from around Europe and as far afield as Canada. The coordinating beneficiary was invited to the EPPO (European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization) head office in order to evaluate the feasibility of transferring the Belgian approach to other EU member States.","Laboratoire d'Ecologie, Université de Liège, Gembloux Agro-Bio Tech (GxABT), Belgium","PCS (Research Centre for Ornamental Plants), Belgium; SPF Environment (Federal Ministry of the Environment), Belgium; CTH (Technical Centre for Horticulture), Belgium",Passage des Déportés 2,5030,Gembloux,BE,50.561786,4.696373,,1262300400 to 1356994800,1262300400 to 1356994800,http://www.alterias.be/,"<a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=3501"">Project summary</a>",Sustainable Growth: Natural Resources,LIFE+,Environment & climate,"Jobs, Growth and Investment;Energy Union and Climate",501482,1010804,DG ENV,English
3574,,Unified information and communication system for nature conservation in NUTS II Moravia-Silesia,INFOMS,https://ec.europa.eu/budget/euprojects/sites/euprojects/files/life08_inf_cz_000443.jpg,"<p>The INFOMS project developed a communication strategy for implementing Natura 2000 objectives in the Czech Republic. The project’s effective cross-sectoral cooperation has raised awareness of nature conservation among 50 communities, as well as landowners and diverse organisations. This has enabled the declaration of 15 new small protected areas without stakeholder conflict. The project has also helped reduce the negative impacts of unauthorised motocross and tree felling, while boosting green tourism.</p>","During the INFOMS project’s implementation, the project team (led by the Moravian-Silesian Region and six partners from diverse state and non-state sectors) proved to be an effective and sustainable example of cross-sectoral cooperation. All partners directly participated in designing and implementing a complex dissemination campaign that combined diverse tools (leaflets, posters, booklets, brochures, bulletins, books, panels and guides for the reconstructed nature trails, information boards and large scale billboards, specialised workshops, specialised websites, or documentary and educational films). A broad spectrum of target groups was also reached. These included the general public, land owners, national, regional and municipal authorities, environmental organisations and experts, teachers and school children, managers and visitors of libraries and information centres, state and private companies, and also some ‘risky’ groups like people engaged in illegal motocross. All planned activities were completed by the agreed end-date of the project and all foreseen dissemination materials were delivered, most of them in exceptional quality (regarding both the information value and graphic design). Most of the activities will continue after the project completion and will be complemented by other scaling-up projects and activities. The complexity, the corporate design (and corporate high quality of the deliverables) and in particular the true networking across state and non-state sectors were the unique innovative values of this successful project.Final results confirmed that the project reached its specific objectives of eliminating conflicts and problems with NATURA 2000 implementation, improving communication and information exchange, and enhancing awareness on nature protection. For example, thanks to the project 15 new small-scale protected areas were declared without any conflict and other protected areas were under preparation. Reconstructed nature trails attracted considerable visitor numbers and supported green tourism opportunities (the automatic visitor-rate monitoring confirmed a stable interest, ranging from 10 000 visitors to 60 000 visitors annually). Surveys carried out before and after the information campaign against illegal motocross and the awareness campaign on NATURA 2000 show increasing recognition of nature protection issues and increasing engagement of various stakeholders. There is an indirect socio-economic effect related to better awareness about the natural beauty of the Moravian Silesian region, which has been generally considered as an industrial (brown field) region.","Moravskoslezský kraj - Krajský úřad, Czech Republic","Agentura ochrany přírody a krajiny, Czech Republic; ACTAEA, Czech Republic; Lesy České republiky s. p., Czech Republic; Ministerstvo životního prostředí, Czech Republic; Občanské sdružení Hájenka, Czech Republic; ČSOP Salamandr, Czech Republic",28. října 117,70218,Ostrava,CZ,49.829789,18.26148,,1262300400 to 1356994800,1262300400 to 1356994800,http://infoms.kr-moravskoslezsky.cz/,"<a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=3505"">Project summary</a>",Sustainable Growth: Natural Resources,LIFE+,Environment & climate,"Jobs, Growth and Investment;Energy Union and Climate",356500,788400,DG ENV,English
3575,,A pilot network of small protected sites for plant species in Bulgaria using the micro-reserve model,BulPlantNet,https://ec.europa.eu/budget/euprojects/sites/euprojects/files/life08_nat_bg_000279.jpg,"<p>The 'BulPlantNet' project halted species loss in Bulgaria through the introduction of plant micro reserves, a conservation strategy pioneered by earlier LIFE projects in Spain. 'BulPlantNet' succeeded in having 58 sites outside the Natura 2000 network designated as 'Small Protected Sites' in Bulgarian legislation. These sites are home to 47 endangered plant species. The project also drafted actions plans for all 47 species.</p>","The 'BulPlantNet' LIFE Bioversity project selected, inventoried and monitored 62 small sites for the conservation of 47 selected endangered plant species in Bulgaria, and deposited 62 proposals for the designation of these sites to the Ministry of Environment and Water (MOEW). From these, 58 were officially designated as 'Small Protected Sites' (SPSs) under Bulgarian legislation, which was almost double the initial target of 30 sites. A total of 47 action plans for all the target plant species were drafted and officially endorsed by the MOEW to safeguard the survival of these species. As a result of establishing action plans for all the target species, during the next ten years the management activities for the maintenance of these territories, which comprise around 1 006 ha in total, will be conducted on a predictable basis. 'BulPlantNet' therefore successfully demonstrational the value of the Plant Micro-Reserve (PMR) model for the first time in Bulgaria. This was applied to protect isolated populations of endangered species in the Bulgarian flora.In addition to establishing protected areas, the project contributed by adding an extra set of measures for habitat maintenance and monitoring, improved scientific knowledge in this area, increased public awareness through information campaigns, and involved all interested parties in conservation activities. The project team created a SPS network database for the subsequent development and sustainable management of sites, with detailed information on all the target species including distribution maps. Training in the field was also conducted for targeted expert groups within different administrative regions. The network of SPSs established by the project covers practically the whole territory of the country. Citizens have been well informed and the network is generally well accepted. This is a good prerequisite for the addition of new sites in the future. There is good potential for the enlargement of the network, through the possible inclusion of the remaining endangered plant species from the Bulgarian flora that meet the criteria of the PMR concept.The project's coordinating beneficiary created an ex situ facility where 21 targeted plant species were propagated and kept for future in situ restoration, according to the recommendations of the action plans. The 'BulPlantNet' model could also be applied to the other countries in the region, as the flora of neighbouring countries had evolved in similar conditions. The project has therefore demonstrated how the PMR concept for the conservation of endangered plant species could be applied throughout the Balkan region. The small sizes of the protected areas, combined with the application of traditional agricultural practices, such as grazing or mowing, are among the reasons for the relatively low level of expenditures expected in creating PMR networks. Therefore, despite its high conservation value, these activities can be characterised as cost-efficient.","Institute of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Research, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Bulgaria","Ministry of Environment and Water, Bulgaria","Acad.

3576,,Restoring semi-natural habitat types to a total cover of site Helnæs,TOTAL COVER HELNÆS,https://ec.europa.eu/budget/euprojects/sites/euprojects/files/life08_nat_dk_000465.jpg,"<p>LIFE funding helped double the area of semi-natural habitats in the Helnaes Natura 2000 network site on the island of Funen. A carefully planned programme of works has restored and connected a mosaic of previously-threatened habitat types, benefitting endangered fauna and flora in the process. The project has also established an economically-viable approach to the long-term management of these sites, involving grazing of meadows.</p>","Project outcomes completed all of the planned activities. Development of habitats 1330, 6210, 6230, 6410, and 7230 in the Natura 2000 site has been secured on an additional area of nearly 70 ha (from 66 ha to 135 ha). The habitat for Liparis loeselii has been increased from 1 ha to 8-10 ha. Water surface was increased on 60 ha and this had an immediate positive effect, significantly increasing the size of bird populations in the area. The structure of vegetation has changed in the areas that were cleared and these plots are now being grazed as a result of the project. The secondary objective was to improve existing, and create new, habitats for Triturus cristatus and Bufo calamita. During the project 23 ponds were established (15 foreseen) and the population of Bufo calamita was strengthened by releasing a large number of small Bufo calamita during August. Restoration in numbers:Purchase of land: 75 ha of 84 ha foreseen, long-term agreements on the rest.Restoration of hydrology: 60 ha of 60 ha foreseen at Helnæs Made.Clearing of trees, bushes and alien species (Rosa rugosa): 21 ha achieved of 15 ha foreseen.Fencing: in total 30 km of fence has been put up or restored, 20 km foreseen.Grazing: 240 ha are being grazed of 201 ha foreseen + five specimen of cattle were bought to secure a sufficient grazing.Restoration / creation of ponds: 23 ponds of 15 ponds foreseen were established + population of Bufo calamita strengthened.These results ensured that the project secured connectivity between terrestrial areas in the site and thus the species targeted by the project are secured by the habitat restoration work. Overall the total area of previously threatened and vulnerable habitats has been doubled, with the suitable areas for Liparis loeselii increasing by a factor of five. In relation to the Water Framework Directive, the nitrogen output into Lillebælt has decreased by approximately six tonnes/year. CO2 emissions from the Helnæs Made area have stopped due to raising of the water level. The increase of water might even increase the formation of peat in the area and thus function as a CO2 sink. Other project benefits included the preparation of Management guidelines for Liparis loeselii that were developed together with Aarhus University. These are completely new as no guidelines existed before. A lot of knowledge and know-how has been collated within the management guidelines. Such information is to be used during future management of the Liparis loeselii areas at Helnæs and also in other areas (e.g. sites covered by LIFE11 NAT/DK/000894 RARE NATURE).Socio-economic impacts relate to increased appreciation about the use of different agricultural subsidies to help sustain long-term management of nature conservation areas and habitats. The LIFE project also made it possible to establish five larger grazing units in the area to secure more economically viable grazing management systems. Robust cattle (such as Highland cattle) were shown to further boost the cost-effectiveness of grazing, particularly during winter months. This encouraged new cooperation between the nature conservation authorities and Highland cattle breeders, which is expected to increase opportunities for on-going grazing of the project areas. Green tourism benefits have also been safeguarded by conserving the site's habitats, which are among the most popular visitor areas on western Funen. Two conference centres (Gl. Brydegaard and Gl. Avernæs) use the project areas in their marketing. It is expected that they will focus on health, local production, and nature experiences in the future in which the Helnæs area can play a major part.","Nature Agency/Naturstyrelsen, Denmark",,"Sollerupvej, 24",5600,Faarbørg,DK,55.15,9.986944,,1262300400 to 1388530800,1262300400 to 1388530800,http://www.naturstyrelsen.dk/Naturbeskyttelse/Naturprojekter/Projekter/Fyn/LIFE-helnaes,"<a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=3552"">Project summary</a>",Sustainable Growth: Natural Resources,LIFE+,Environment & climate,"Jobs, Growth and Investment;Energy Union and Climate",1264967,2529934,DG ENV,English
3577,,Restoration of habitats of Community interest in the Basque Country's estuaries,Estuarios del Pais Vasco,https://ec.europa.eu/budget/euprojects/sites/euprojects/files/life08_nat_e_000055.jpg,"<p>Estuarine habitats of EU importance in Spain’s Basque Country are threatened by the presence of the exotic and invasive bushy shrub, Baccharis halimifolia. This project implemented an ambitious campaign to combat the invasive species in three Basque estuary sites. The work entailed physical and chemical methods of removal and avoided the use of heavy machinery. More than 570 000 mature and five million juvenile plants of the invasive shrub were removed from a 212 hectare-area.</p>","The Estuarios del Pais Vasco project implemented an ambitious control campaign for the target invasive species Baccharis halimifolia in protected areas of three Basque Country estuaries: Urdaibai, Lea and Txingudi. The eradication work entailed physical and chemical methods, and avoided the use of heavy machinery in order to reduce damage to the environment. It consisted of hand-pulling seedlings (over 590 ha) and cutting larger specimens by means of chainsaw and applying repeated brushings of herbicide (glyphosate) to the stumps (over 192 ha). In addition, herbicide was reapplied to re-sprouting shrubs and female specimens were selectively cleared before flowering. In all, about 570 000 adult specimens of Baccharis halimifolia were removed and more than 5 000 000 young plants were extracted by means of hand-pulling. In all, the invasive plant has been completely removed from around 212 ha. The habitat improvement in the three estuary areas was clearly evident. Better results were observed in Urdaibai and Lea, where it is not necessary to re-plant native vegetation.Reforestation was conducted in certain areas of the estuary of Txingudi, where more than 6 000 specimens of 13 different species, coming from a plant nursery operated by the regional government of Gipuzkoa, were used to reinforce the regeneration of the native vegetation. In addition to the improvements in the shrub and meadow habitats of Community interest, the amount of mudflat and sandflat habitat has also considerably increased. Significant increases recorded for both the area and quality of Phragmites australis (common reed) communities directly benefits bird species. The project’s monitoring programme showed that the removal of Baccharis halimifolia was effectively implemented in the three project areas. In Urdaibai, where the species is scattered over a marshy area, a significant though reduced re-sprouting rate was observed. In Lea and Txingudi, where the invasive species’ presence is more concentrated, the effectiveness of the control work has been high from the beginning, with very low re-sprouting rates in both areas. By the end of the project, the distribution of Baccharis halimifolia along the Basque coast had been mapped.During the four years of the project’s implementation, the Aranzadi Society of Sciences studied vegetation re-establishment in 45 plots and along 164 transects in the three project areas. In all three estuaries, a rapid development of the natural vegetation was observed, especially in Urdaibai. Nonetheless, despite the positive trend, Baccharis halimifolia continues to be a problem and project continuity is emphasised in the After-LIFE Conservation Plan, along with the need for preventive and corrective measures for other invasive plant species such as Cortaderia selloana, Spartina patents (Urdaibai), Aster squamatus (Lea) and Phytolaca americana (Txingudi). To ensure minimal negative effects on the environment from the use of the herbicide, GAIMAZ, the company contracted to do the eradication work, drafted protocols for the management of glyphosate. Researchers from the University of the Basque Country also conducted a study of glyphosate toxicity in the Mediterranean mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis), while the Aranzadi Society of Sciences analysed soil samples from the experimental plots and showed herbicide concentrations far below the LC50 (median lethal concentration) established in a toxicity study.The project conducted various communication and awareness-raising activities, for example, through a website, information boards and leaflets, press releases, TV and radio features, guided visits, and Biodiversity Week activities. Project results were disseminated through the layman’s report, and at workshops and conferences. The project produced the 'Manual for the Management of Baccharis halimifolia', which arose from a specialised International Commission meeting held in the framework of the project. In addition, the beneficiaries organised two technical conferences on invasive species. The project’s findings relating to the control of invasive plant species have been integrated into conservation measures for the three estuaries and in the hydrological plan of the Basque Country, approved in 2012 in line with the EU Water Framework Directive. The best practice restoration techniques demonstrated can be readily implemented in other European estuaries experiencing similar problems. These project outcomes are a valuable support for the implementation of the new EU Regulation on Invasive Alien Species.","Departamento de Medio Ambiente y Ordenación del Territorio.

3578,,Recovery of riparian habitats of the Ter river,Riparia-Ter,https://ec.europa.eu/budget/euprojects/sites/euprojects/files/life08_nat_e_000072.jpg,"<p>The Riparia-Ter project targeted riparian habitats along areas of the river Ter in Catalonia. It worked to conserve the diversity of existing vegetation and to create sustainable habitats. Through woodland management, the control of invasive species and reforestation, the project successfully recovered 75 hectares of river forest habitats.</p>","The LIFE Riparia-Ter project was carried out by the Alba-Ter Consortium in four areas in the mid and lower stretches of the Ter river, which are included in the Natura 2000 network area 'Riberes del Baix Ter'. The municipal councils of Bescanó, Sant Gregori, Salt, Girona and Jafre actively cooperated with the project. The main habitat restoration actions involved woodland management, the control of invasive species, and reforestation. During the course of the project, the coordinating beneficiary applied specific criteria to encourage vigorous, well-structured riparian woodlands. Native species typical of riverside habitats were given priority, especially those species that provide food, shelter or nesting sites for wildlife. The treatment of the woods and riverside communities also took into account the existing plant communities and their condition, the presence of dead wood and the presence of urban areas and infrastructures. Actions in alluvial forests in the four project areas included selective logging, tree thinning, scrub clearance, grazing management, and the control of exotic species. Much of the project's efforts were invested in controlling invasive alien species. An in-depth study assessed the most effective and economically-viable methods for managing invasive species, while actions were implemented to remove invasive species so that riverside habitats could recover. The main invasive species causing riparian habitat degradation were box elder (Acer negundo), tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima), black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia), Japanese privet (Ligustrum japonicum) and giant cane (Arundo donax).The project's actions produced very good results, though it is a relatively costly management system that requires training and the commitment of personnel to guarantee success. The protocols developed for the control of invasive species are available on the project’s website. In order to improve riparian woodlands, typical native riverside species were planted, such as black alder (Alnus glutinosa), narrow-leaved ash (Fraxinus angustifolia), white poplar (Populus alba), white willow (Salix alba), field elm (Ulmus minor) and elder (Sambucus nigra). More than 7 000 specimens of these trees were utilised by the project team, enabling them to recover areas that had previously been colonised by invasive species. Supplementary planting also encouraged denser growth in other deteriorated areas. It was necessary to obtain certified native seedlings, to guarantee optimum adaptability and survival, and these were collected in nearby areas. Around 500 students from local municipalities were involved with the tree planting activities. The project's activities led to the recovery of 75 ha of river forest habitats (91E0*, 92A0). Forest management and the control of invasive species also benefitted other habitat types in the area, such as holm oak woods (9340), pine woods (9540) and dry meadows (6220*). In total, actions were undertaken in an area of over 80 ha.One of the project's main objectives was to restore seasonal flood zones, especially temporary Mediterranean lagoons and ponds. These are a very scarce habitat type, both locally and in European terms. The work undertaken to change the river's morphology resulted in the recovery of six wetland areas on old branches of the River Ter, with a total surface area of 0.82 ha. Three ponds were created in Salt; another restored in the Quirze Marsh; and three further ponds were created around the Illa d’Avall in the municipality of Jafre. The restoration of temporary flood habitats has bought back characteristic vegetation (including halophyte plants) and wildlife (amphibians, invertebrates and marshland birds). The LIFE project regulated public use of the restored areas, to help prevent habitat degradation and fragmentation, disturbance to wildlife and fly-tipping. Vehicular access was restricted in all four project areas, using wooden barriers and rocks to deter motorists. Two walking itineraries were created in the 'Riberes del Baix Ter' area, to raise awareness and encourage public access compatible with the protection of local habitats and heritage. The first route runs for approximately one km around the Illa de la Pilastra has a wildlife observatory; while the second walk at Illa d'Avall runs for around 1.65 km. Information panels have been erected along these pathways and in the other project areas.A project website (www.liferipariater.com/) was launched in 2010 to disseminate a wide range of relevant information; eight editions of the Riparia-Ter newsletter were published during the project and thousands of leaflets have been distributed locally. Public awareness was also raised through meetings with schools, universities, environmental organisations and the general public (involved some 1 400 people); 77 guided tours around the areas (attended by 1 656 people); and through an itinerant exhibition (BiodiversiTER) displayed in 27 municipalities that highlighted the threat of invasive species. The involvement of local people in tree planting, bird-ringing and other activities, including those initiated after a serious fire in the Illa d'Avall area in 2013, has helped facilitate the town councils' willingness to continue participating in habitat restoration projects within the After-LIFE Conservation Plans.","Consorci Alba-Ter, Spain","Ajuntament de Bescanó, Spain; Ajuntament de Salt, Spain; Ajuntament de Girona, Spain","Plaça Fra Bernadí, 6",8560,Manlleu,ES,42,2.2836,,1262300400 to 1356994800,1262300400 to 1356994800,http://www.liferipariater.com/,"<a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=3576"">Project summary</a>",Sustainable Growth: Natural Resources,LIFE+,Environment & climate,"Jobs, Growth and Investment;Energy Union and Climate",464550,929100,DG ENV,English
3579,,Restoration of Raised Bog Habitats in the Especially Protected Nature Areas of Latvia,Raised Bogs,https://ec.europa.eu/budget/euprojects/sites/euprojects/files/life08_nat_lv_000449.jpg,"<p>The 'Raised Bogs' project prepared management plans and regulatory documents for four protected areas of active raised bog habitat in Latvia, in collaboration with local stakeholder groups. After carrying out hydrological studies, conservation work included building dams on drainage ditches. The total restored habitat area was 488 ha - almost twice the area originally targeted.</p>","The management plans for all four project sites - Aizkraukle Mire and Forests, Aklais Mire, Melnais Lake Mire and Rozu Mire Nature Reserves - were approved by the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Regional Development. These management plans serve as guidelines for the implementation of restoration actions on these Natura 2000 sites and, as such, are a useful tool for helping the Nature Conservation Agency, Regional Environment protection boards and land owners/managers ensure sustainable conservation of the sites.Hydrological studies of active raised bog were conducted before the concrete conservation activities, which included the building of dams on drainage ditches at all four project sites using an excavator. The total restored habitat area was 488 ha (instead of the originally foreseen 290 ha). The positive effect of building the dams was clearly evident at all the project sites, with monitoring results showing that the water was raised to a new stable level and that typical raised bogs' vegetation was gradually regenerating. The blocking of drainage ditches should prevent further degradation and establish the conditions necessary for successful raised bog habitats regeneration. Eventually, sphagnum species should begin to dominate in the wetter areas, enabling active peat formation processes to be restored. There was an increase of sphagnum cover in the Melnais Lake Mire just six month after dam construction.Public awareness on raised bogs conservation was raised through various activities. Five project booklets (one general and four dedicated to each project site) and a layman's report were published and distributed. The beneficiary published a 244 page book, 'Raised Bog Management for Biological Diversity Conservation in Latvia', in Latvian and English that included detailed information about the value of protecting raised bogs and recommendations for their management and monitoring, based on findings from all four project sites. A travelling exhibition 'Secrets of Mires' was prepared and presented in 30 different locations, with ten accompanying seminars addressing different stakeholder groups. A documentary film entitled 'Mires Uncovered' was produced and shown in Latvian schools, nature education centres, universities, museums, libraries, and at international nature film festivals in Estonia and Portugal. It is also available on the project website (www.purvi.lv), along with detailed information on all the project's results and deliverables.The project’s international conference 'Sharing experience on Raised Bog Restoration' was attended by 50 participants from seven European countries. In addition, the project conducted a wide range of networking activities, including exchange contacts with LIFE projects in Wales and Germany, involving study tours, seminars, conferences and meetings. The conservation actions on active raised bog should benefit up to eight priority habitats of the Habitats Directive, including degraded raised bogs still capable of natural regeneration, transition mires and quaking bogs, depressions on peat substrates of the Rhynchosporion, and natural dystrophic lakes and ponds, along with the many species these habitats support. The project developed good practice in active raised bog habitat restoration in Latvia. The new experience obtained is applicable regionally, nationally and internationally, and using the prepared management plans it could be put into practice in Natura 2000 sites in several other EU countries.","University of Latvia, Latvia","Latvian Fund for Nature, Latvia; Association of Documentary Film and Photography ELM MEDIA, Latvia",Raina Blvd. 19,1050,Riga,LV,56.9489,24.1064,,1262300400 to 1356994800,1262300400 to 1356994800,http://www.purvi.lv/,"<a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=3542"">Project summary</a>",Sustainable Growth: Natural Resources,LIFE+,Environment & climate,"Jobs, Growth and Investment;Energy Union and Climate",545035,726714,DG ENV,English

The project addressed the population decline caused by poaching and juvenile mortality, reconnected fragmented bear habitats and worked to overcome conflicts between these large carnivores and the local community, including through the promotion of local products linked to the bears, such as honey.</p>","The URSUSLIFE project achieved its objectives focused on:Maintaining the current conservation status of the Carpathian brown bear population by applying best practices and demonstrative actions in the project's area and promoting these methods at national level.Preventing brown bear's population decline caused by poaching, habituation and juvenile mortality.Preventing and reducing conflicts between bears and humans.Maintaining the current conservation status in 15 Natura 2000 sites, overlapping the project area.These outcomes were achieved by the following project results:Elaborating and disseminating a Guide on the assessment methods for brown bear population that was approved by the national authority. It explains optimal quantitative and qualitative methods for counting brown bear populations and individuals. This handbook will be used by wildlife managers and field agents;Reducing the number of cases when killing a bear was considered the only solution, by relocating problem bears and promoting alternative measures and extending at national level the project's experiences;Approval by the environmental national authority of a standard methodology for risk evaluation of problem bears and habituated bears. The Risk Assessment Team (RAT) participated in 52 cases (14 in Vrancea County, 15 in Covasna County, and 23 in Harghita County) where it was necessary to conduct a contextual assessment, due to damage caused by bears. Experience gained from these 52 cases informed the development of a 'Methodology for the assessment of risks raised by the presence of bears in inhabited areas'. Such a project result included recommendations on working procedures and criteria by which risk assessment can be made;Poached and snare trapped bears were saved throughout the range of the entire project;All abandoned and orphaned bear cubs identified by the project were rehabilitated following an increase in the Rehabilitation Center's intervention and receiving capacity. Cubs of problem female bears were also rehabilitated by the project. The ARMU (Animal Rescue Mobile Unit) expanded its activity in Covasna and Harghita counties. It participated in the capture of bears (in situations where relocation was considered a solution), releasing them from snares, or taking other species of wild animals kept in captivity and releasing them after a period of rehabilitation. From 2010 to 2013 the ARMU team intervened in 17 cases where bears had been captured in illegally placed snares. The RAT and ARMU team worked together in six actions that ended with the relocation of nine bears. During the same period, the ARMU team and the Association for Nature Values Conservation (from Balan locality) helped to rehabilitate 37 orphaned or abandoned bear cubs that have been, or are in the process of being, released into their natural habitat;A total of 76 dens and 64 den areas were mapped and recorded in a database. All categories of wintering areas and bear dens were also structured in a GIS database. Such data can now be correlated with other GIS models;Some 30 electrical fence systems were installed each year around shepherd camps, crops and beehives in order to reduce bear damage on farms throughout the project area.These helped to promote best practices among farmers in order to reduce bear damages;Habitat fragmentation and degradation was reduced by achieving several proposals that ensured the connectivity of Natura 2000 sites designated for conservation of the bear species. Legacies from this work will be sustained by a Practical guide for preventing brown bear's habitat degradation and fragmentation that was developed by the project and approved by the Ministry of Environment;Negative attitudes toward bears and Natura 2000 sites were also decreased among local people by promoting local products.","Vrancea Environmental Protection Agency, Romania","Association for Biological Diversity Conservation, Romania; Environmental Protection Agency Harghita, Romania; Association for Nature Values Conservation, Romania; Environmental Protection Agency Covasna, Romania",2 Dinicu Golescu,620106,Focsani,RO,45.7,27.1797,,1262300400 to 1356994800,1262300400 to 1356994800,http://www.carnivoremari.ro/ursul.php,"<a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=3559"">Project summary</a>",Sustainable Growth: Natural Resources,LIFE+,Environment & climate,"Jobs, Growth and Investment;Energy Union and Climate",386300,515066,DG ENV,English
3581,,Conservation of Aquila pomarina in Romania,CAPR,https://ec.europa.eu/budget/euprojects/sites/euprojects/files/life08_nat_ro_000501.jpg,"<p>The CAPR project targeted Romanian populations of the lesser spotted eagle (Aquila pomarina), working to stabilise numbers at around 2 000 pairs and ensuring a long-term favourable conservation statue. Key actions included the protection of nesting and breeding areas and monitoring of individuals with transmitters. In addition, some 1 500 electric pylons were insulated to reduce eagle mortality.</p>","The CAPR project achieved its expected objectives – contributing to the improvement of conservation status for the Aquila pomarina species in Romania. Importantly, the works carried out indicate very good long term sustainability and have had an important, national impact. Among the main achievements were the drafting and publication of two important documents: a National Action Plan for the species and the 'Lesser Spotted Eagle- friendly habitat management guidelines'. These are contributing to the updating of the European Action Plan for species (threats and actions), carried out in co-operation with the LIFE project for the conservation of A. pomarina in Slovakia.As planned, a buffer zone system was developed and implemented in co-operation with forest owners and/or managers in order to better protect the nesting areas. In total, 82 nests have been protected through buffer zones in three of the targeted sites. Some 116 nests have been secured, with the mounting of 101 artificial nesting platforms and 20 barriers have been constructed to limit access to sensitive areas of the forests. Also, to reduce disturbance and to protect 26 specific nesting grounds, 100 warning signs have been put up along public forest tracks. A third important area of activity concerned works to eliminate, or significantly reduce threats to the species from overhead electric cables. To this end, some 1 286 medium voltage poles were insulated, with an expected reduction by over 90% of the cases of bird kill due to electrocution.Another important achievement was to improve awareness of the importance of protecting the species both among stakeholders and the general public. Concerning stakeholders, more than 40 000 land owners have been informed about the protection of A. pomarina species in Romania and of the importance of species-friendly pastures and other management activities. Moreover meetings and awareness raising workshops were organised with over 350 stakeholders (forestry officials, local authorities, NGOs, SPA managers and custodians) across the twelve project sites. Finally, numerous communication and dissemination activities were carried out. These included the production of a documentary about the species, shown on national TV and distributed (400 DVDs) to schools, universities and nature NGOs. The project's conservation work has also been referred to over a 200 times - in the local and national media, and also in a TV spot broadcast by ten television stations. Furthermore, 54 information boards have been placed around the project sites and various information material has been produced and distributed for stakeholders and for schools and the general public.","Environmental Agency Sibiu, Romania","Romanian Ornithological Society (partner of BirdLife International), Romania; Milvus Group Association, Romania","Hipodromului, No: 2A",550360,Sibiu,RO,45.7928,24.1521,,1262300400 to 1356994800,1262300400 to 1356994800,http://www.pomarina.ro/,"<a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=3560"">Project summary</a>",Sustainable Growth: Natural Resources,LIFE+,Environment & climate,"Jobs, Growth and Investment;Energy Union and Climate",1413104,1884138,DG ENV,English
3582,,Conservation and surveillance of conservation status of wolf (Canis lupus) population in Slovenia,SloWolf,https://ec.europa.eu/budget/euprojects/sites/euprojects/files/life08_nat_slo_000244.jpg,"<p>This project established a national wolf surveillance system, which gave important new insights into wolf behaviour. These fed into a Wolf Management Action Plan, developed in close cooperation with key interest groups. The plan identified potential 'hot spots' for wolf-human conflict and recommended best practices for dealing with them. The beneficiary's advocacy work led to the adoption of the Wolf Management Action Plan by the Slovenian government. The project also quantified the economic benefits of wolf-friendly farming methods.</p>","The SloWolf project outcomes clarified the status and dynamics of Slovenia's wolf population by using a range of available methods, including innovative genetic methods. Findings indicate that the population is stable and contains between 35 and 40 wolves, despite annual culling quotas and occasional poaching. This project showed many very innovative technologies in DNA-based identification of individual wolves. The primers used and other methodological clues will be published in scientific papers and made available for a wider scientific audience. The knowledge obtained in this project has already been used in similar projects dealing with large carnivores in Europe. The genetic tools represent state-of-the-art techniques in conservation biology of mammals in general. Project monitoring of the wolf population provided a basic prerequisite for controlling the species' long-term conservation status.The project developed tools for managing other important issues such as prey species management, institutional cooperation, trans-boundary cooperation, and illegal killings of wolves. Project results also produced comprehensive data sets and other information outputs such as a wolf portal, bulletins, posters, brochures, recommendations, instructions, film and an action plan. The latter Wolf Action Plan (adopted by the government) was based on scientific knowledge about the population and its habitat. It provides a firm foundation for wolf conservation and management. The Wolf Conservation Action, that was adopted by the Slovenian Government, was developed within the project through a participative process with interested stakeholders. Economic aspects of different farming practices with or without wolf/bear damages were analysed. These helped to demonstrate the benefits of wolf-friendly farming within the wolf range. Electric fences and shepherd dogs were proved by the project to be useful tools for preventing wolf damage on farms. During the project's first two years, protection measures against damages in agriculture were lowered. The financial compensation for wolf attacks paid to the farmers in 2013 was EUR 200 000 less than in the previous years, when fences were not used.Annual national culling quotas declined during the project, reducing to zero in 2014. The public response was outstanding in terms of media coverage (144 written articles, 32 TV emissions, 361 internet articles). This helped to improve the perception of wolves by Slovenia's media and general public. The project's wolf conference, held in September 2013, was also successful. It attracted 164 participants and hosted 52 lectures plus poster presentations from 22 countries. Some 2 429 volunteers were trained and participated in the project actions. Theese volunteers, alongside a network of hunters, are now able to participate in wolf population monitoring activities.","University of Ljubljana, Biotehniška fakulteta, Oddelek za biologijo, Slovenia","Slovenia Forest Service, Slovenia; Dinaricum Society, Slovenia",Večna pot 111,1000,Ljubljana,SI,46.0556,14.5083,,1262300400 to 1356994800,1262300400 to 1356994800,http://www.volkovi.si,"<a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=3554"">Project summary</a>",Sustainable Growth: Natural Resources,LIFE+,Environment & climate,"Jobs, Growth and Investment;Energy Union and Climate",721850,1017773,DG ENV,English
3583,,Policy support system for atmospheric pollution hot spots,ATMOSYS,https://ec.europa.eu/budget/euprojects/sites/euprojects/files/life09_env_be_000409.jpg,"<p>The objective of this project was to set up, evaluate, and demonstrate an advanced air quality modelling system and associated web-based service, containing novel elements specifically designed for air pollution policy support in hot-spot regions. The system is based on advanced technology, including prognostic 3-D atmospheric computer models.</p>","To achieve the goal of demonstrating an advanced air quality modelling system, the project's coordinating beneficiary, the Flemish Research and Technology Organisation (VITO), collaborated closely with the key end-user partners, the Belgian Interregional Environment Agency (IRCEL-CELINE) and the Flemish Environment Agency (VMM). Project activities were conducted in four core stages. Firstly, the project partners designed the architecture of the ATMOSYS web-based system and its various functionalities, and also prepared the air quality modelling tools. The implementation stage involved the development of these functionalities and the generation of various air quality data through specific urban measurement campaigns, emission inventory development and multi-spatial model simulations. During the third stage, the project evaluated the functionalities and the air quality services. The final demonstration stage involved the implementation of the website (www.atmosys.eu) to host the air quality system and its various applications. This operated both as a test platform for potential users to explore air quality information and to disseminate the various findings.The final ATMOSYS demonstration system is essentially an Air Quality Management Dashboard that the project team developed to help Environmental Protection Agencies (EPAs) predict, assess and plan air quality. This will support EPAs in their role of making policy decisions to improve air quality and to inform the public on the status of air quality. The dashboard provides three main services: forecasting, assessing and planning. In each case, ATMOSYS offers different possible solutions to provide the most relevant information, with a strong emphasis on quality and usability. The ATMOSYS dashboard is constructed in a modular fashion, with a number of building blocks that can be applied according to the specific needs and air quality conditions of the region of implementation. Once the building blocks have been selected and configured, ATMOSYS enables experts and policy-makers to monitor, assess, validate, analyse and improve the air quality situation. Users can assess air quality, for example, using annual high-resolution air quality maps, including AQ Directive indicators, time series data, a model evaluation tool and an exposure calculation. This can inform decisions to implement smog warnings, reduce traffic speed, implement low-emission zones, and other air pollutant mitigation measures in hot spot regions.The demonstration system was set up for the European hot spot region of Flanders, Belgium. Near real-time monitoring data and modelling results, including data assimilation techniques, were made available by means of INSPIRE-compliant ICT technology to offer a multitude of data about local air pollution. The ATMOSYS website demonstrated the building blocks incorporated into the air quality management system in Flanders. However, the system can be customised when deployed in other regions, for example, by changing the air quality models used or the associated web-based services. There are basically three major parts in the demonstration system: a front-end interface for experts with a web-based visualisation/control system for air quality management; a public information interface that is also a valuable tool for raising public awareness; and the back-end components that provide most of the modelling, validation, analysis and reporting functionality. The core back-end components comprise a system database, which integrates all data sources required for air quality management; modelling components that enable current and near-future air quality to be calculated; and decision-support components for helping decide which measures to take when air quality problems occur.The monitoring and modelling of elemental carbon (EC) in Flanders was pioneered in this LIFE project. Its monitoring is not yet required under the Air Quality Directive and it is currently undertaken in few EU Member States. EC is a more suitable indicator of traffic pollution than PM, however, and the ATMOSYS measurement campaigns provided valuable information on the EC component of PM, as well as black carbon concentrations near a highway. Innovative 3-D atmospheric computer models were also used during the project to model air pollutants at street level to benefit urban planning. Taken together, measures to improve air quality can improve the general state of health of the population and help to reduce healthcare costs.","Vlaamse Instelling voor Technologisch Onderzoek NV, Belgium","The Flemish Environment Agency VMM (Vlaamse Milieumaatschappij), Belgium",Boeretang 200,2400,Mol,BE,51.2189841,5.0938936,,1262300400 to 1356994800,1262300400 to 1356994800,,"<a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=3758"">Project summary</a>",Sustainable Growth: Natural Resources,LIFE+,Environment & climate,"Jobs, Growth and Investment;Energy Union and Climate",1087488,2353615,DG ENV,English
3584,,Climate Change Adaptation of the Structural Ceramics Industry by Decreasing the Firing Temperature,LASERFIRING,https://ec.europa.eu/budget/euprojects/sites/euprojects/files/life09_env_es_000435.jpg,"<p>The LASERFIRING project intended to develop a new method for manufacturing structural ceramics using laser technology in the firing phase, which would allow firing at lower temperatures. In the particular case of refractory bricks, the new process would reduce the firing temperature from 1 300ºC to about 900ºC, without compromising aesthetic or structural properties.</p>","The LASERFIRING project achieved all its targets: the beneficiaries set up and validated a prototype for the development of a new line of ceramic products for the building industry, which reduces CO2 emissions. The prototype achieved reduction of 40%, in the best cases, and of 10% in the worse ones. It also showed that for products that have higher treatment temperatures in the conventional process the possibilities for reduction of CO2 emissions by means of the 'LASERFIRING' process are greater. The LASERFIRING technology and process is upscalable to a semi-industrial process for some materials and sectors such as wall and ceramic tiles The beneficiary believe that it could be feasible to install ten LASERFIRING furnaces of medium size (300 tonnes/day) in the next ten years. This entails a production of 1 100 000 tonnes/year that will lead to a reduction in CO2 emissions of 90 000 to 15 000 tonnes/year, depending on the decrease of the treatment temperature. The reduction of emissions and the energy savings may be quantified, depending on the starting mineral composition.Energy savings and reduction of CO2 emissions achieved for:White firing clay – 28-34%Red fired clays – 10-14%Black bricks – about 35%Gressified clay – 20-30%A pilot was designed to test the new process on different ceramic pastes. However, the project did not achieve good results with certain types of brick. The resistance to frosting is very poor and the required temperatures for obtaining bricks with suitable characteristics would be more or less the same than those used in the standard process. Although the four sides of the bricks have been treated, the project has not achieved an uniformity of treatment in the faces. Since the problem only occurs in the front and back faces of the brick but not in the upper and lower edges (the distance between the laser and the edges does not vary), the project leaders reached the conclusion that the origin of the problem is the low power of the laser. With a higher power, they concluded, this problem would be solved. The determination of the exact suitable power, however, was beyond the scope of the project.Furthermore, the project demonstrated the feasibility of its process for bricks which show practically the range of colours of the current commercial products, but with the advantage that they do not require additives. Moreover, it was possible to obtain aesthetic effects that are impossible to achieve by means of the standard process. Another major advantage is cost: the installation costs of a LASERFIRING facility are around 10% cheaper than those of a conventional one. The project results were widely disseminated among the sector through conferences, fairs, organised visits to the pilot plant and technical courses. The main threat for the continuity of the project achievements on an industrial level is the lack of power of the laser equipment used. For this reason, the beneficiaries are considering applying for financing programmes, such as the CIP-EIP-ECO-INNOVATION, in order to scale up the process. Also, the know-how gained by the project is being applied in the follow-up LIFE project (LIFE11 ENV/ES/000560 CERAMGLASS - Environmentally Friendly Processing of Ceramics and Glass), which planned to construct a laser furnace for the treatment of ceramic and glass tiles.","Instituto de Ciencia de Materiales de Aragón, (CSIC-Universidad de Zaragoza), Spain","Asociación para la Investigación y Desarrollo Industrial de los Recursos Naturales (AITEMIN), Spain; Physicgm, Spain; Easylasser, Spain","Maria de Luna, 3",50018,Zaragoza,ES,41.65,-0.8833,,1262300400 to 1356994800,1262300400 to 1356994800,http://www.laserfiring.eu/Proyecto_LASERFIRING/LASERFIRING.html,"<a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=3659"">Project summary</a>",Sustainable Growth: Natural Resources,LIFE+,Environment & climate,"Jobs, Growth and Investment;Energy Union and Climate",1232179,2468358,DG ENV,English
3585,,Combating climate change through farming,AgriClimateChange,https://ec.europa.eu/budget/euprojects/sites/euprojects/files/life09_env_es_000441.jpg,"<p>Farming emissions represent some 11% of total EU greenhouse gas emissions. The 'AgriClimateChange' project identified and promoted sustainable agricultural practices in France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. It also developed the AgriClimateChange tool to help assess and measure energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at farm level.</p>","The 'AgriClimateChange' project results were numerous:Provided effective tools that help to measure energy and GHG emissions balances/reductions at farm level.Identified agricultural support measures that contribute to fight climate change.Confirmed opportunities for improving EU legislation and regulation in this field.Raised considerable awareness among influential stakeholders and decision-makers about effective and quantifiable climate action on Europe’s farms.Outcomes focused on the development and testing of a new assessment tool (called the AgriClimateChange Tool) which during three years was used to assess more than 149 farms, from four Member States covering more than 20 productive systems. Taking into account the results obtained in the assessments, the project experts elaborated 'Action Plans' that were specifically designed for each farm, and reflected the results and the characteristics of the farm. These plans identified key elements in the farms’ management systems where scope existed for improving energy consumption and GHG emissions (and associated economic savings for the farms). Action plan content also included proposed measures that were agreed with the farm to improve energy consumption and GHG emissions (and associated economic savings for the farms). Results showed energy and GHG reductions of 10-40% could be reached by most farms through implementing the proposed measures.The measures were focused on agronomic techniques, livestock and manure management, fossil energy reduction and carbon storage. Such findings informed the drafting of Global Proposals concerning EU, national and regional measures, especially in the context of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Among them, twelve measures were selected as the more efficient to fight against climate change and to reduce energy consumption at farm level, taking into account not only their mitigation potential but also other aspects such as technical feasibility, implementation and monitoring cost, suitability to be included in the (2013) CAP reform, etc. Project partners met members of the European Commission (EC) and Parliament (EP) several times during the project in order to suggest policy measures in relation to climate change in agriculture. After the project, and during the reporting phase, the EC and the EP invited the project to present their results and policy proposals.An intensive programme of advocacy work was also carried out in the four countries addressing regional and national administrations. This experience is also being replicated by private and local initiatives in other countries of Europe. The project included a useful and varied collection of effective communication and awareness-raising activities in order to reach key stakeholders such as farmers, Farmer Unions, professional associations, consumers and experts also working on farming and climate change. As the farming sector is diverse, the communication campaign included several tools, such as a website, notice boards, press releases, radio and TV, specialised press, agricultural fairs and events for farmers. The project was explained to more than 650 farmers, more than 300 pieces of news related to the project (web, local and specialised press), were published, the website had nearly 71 000 different visitors (involving more than 600 000 visits in three years), the manual was downloaded more than 3 300 times and the partners participated in more than 70 events to explain the project and its results. In October 2013, over 150 participants from a mix of European countries attended the project’s European Conference on Farming and Climate Change in Toulouse (France), where the main project results were successfully disseminated and supported by a broad spectrum of farming, environmental, and consumer/civil society bodies.","Fundación Global Nature, Spain","Solagro, France; Consejería de Agricultura de la Región de Murcia, Spain; Bodensee Stiftung, Germany; Comunità Montana-Associazione dei Comuni Trasimeno-Medio Tevere, Italy","Corro del Postigo, 1",34331,Fuentes de Nava,ES,42.0833,-4.7833,,1262300400 to 1356994800,1262300400 to 1356994800,http://www.agriclimatechange.eu/,"<a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=3655"">Project summary</a>",Sustainable Growth: Natural Resources,LIFE+,Environment & climate,"Jobs, Growth and Investment;Energy Union and Climate",794495,1588990,DG ENV,English
3586,,Improving the environmental performance of publications from design to lecture!,GREENING BOOKS,https://ec.europa.eu/budget/euprojects/sites/euprojects/files/life09_env_es_000457.jpg,"<p>The objective of GREENING BOOKS is to improve the environmental performance of the publishing sector. This project aims to develop an innovative instrument aimed at all stakeholders across the entire life-cycle of the publishing process, by integrating existing tools, such as Ecolabel, EMAS, Eco-design and LCA, as well as the latest technologies.</p>","Results from the GREENING BOOKS project's activities demonstrated that the publishing sector can minimise its environmental impact. Key results associated with this have established useful mechanisms to increase eco-publishing practices in the graphic and publishing sector by providing stakeholders with new measures and tools. These include a new quantification system to calculate the potential environmental impacts of a publication (via LCA). This BookDAPer e-tool was developed using the pre-defined environmental criteria and LCA results. LCA conclusions confirmed that the main environmental impact of publications relates to consumption of raw materials (paper and inks). The plate manufacturing and distribution also have a relevant impact. When analysing the best practice to introduce in the sector it was seen that:use of recycled paper can reduce the impact between 15 and 50%use of vegetable oil inks gives lower values than mineral inks only in some of the categories of impactA demonstration version of the software was made available on-line. BookDAPer allows users to identify and quantify the environmental impacts of publishing products (books and magazines). The e-tool and methodology were tested and demonstrated by publishing a magazine and three books.The BookDAPer demonstrated how, by applying the best practices included in the Handbook, the environmental impact of these publications was reduced as well as the cost. This resulted in the design of an ecolabel, BDAP, to communicate the impact of a publication to its end user. The ecolabel BDAP describes the environmental certifications and good environmental practices of the companies involved in the edition, design and printing of the publication and potential environmental impact of the printed product with these environmental indicators:carbon footprint (g CO2 eq.)waste production (g)water consumption (l)energy consumption (kJ)raw materials consumption (g)In addition, it includes the potential environmental savings with the appliance of environmental criteria in the publication. This ecolabel BDAP tool also reduces the need for high professional knowledge on the matter. The manual provides a guide on the best practice to be used, in an understandable language for the sector. The BDAP label can be considered innovative since it integrates quantitative information about specific environmental impacts (carbon footprint, waste, water, energy and raw materials) with the good practices already available in the legislation/market. The innovation includes the way this label is produced using the BookDAPer tool.During the project, El Tinter published 127 books and magazines using the BDAP tool and the project team estimated an average of 3 500 books per title, for which the following environmental benefits were produced:Reduction of energy consumption: 1.2 MJ (or 0.33 kWh)Reduction of the carbon footprint: 15.73 tons of CO2 eq.Reduction of waste production: 800 kgReduction of water consumption: 5 245 m3Saving of raw materials: seven tonnesAnother outcome was the publication of the 'Good practice guide' for eco-publishing and eco-design. Its contents include environmental criteria to reduce the environmental impact in printed products as books and magazines. Outcomes from applying good practices include social benefits (e.g. use of inks that do not emit VOC and therefore, improving the health conditions of the printing workers; and the use of paper from sustainable sources, from sustainable forest management), and increase in the knowledge and awareness of the agents involved in the publication chain: designers, publishers, printers, booksellers and readers. This was achieved in part through several technical workshops and other events that took place in order to guarantee the participation of all interested parties in the definition of good practices and environmental criteria in the sector. Very useful information exchanges occurred during the workshops, which also succeeded in disseminating environmental criteria and good practices on environmental issues to many professionals involved in printing products. These dissemination actions provided significant inputs to the project activities and at the same time made a difference in the attitude of the publishers, printers and editors, who now better appreciate (and remain more open to learning about) the benefits of environmental considerations.The aforementioned project results contributed to the implementation of some of the sixth Environment Action Programme of the European Commission for 2002 - 2012, and the 7the EAP. Moreover, the BookDAPer tool integrates all the European eco-labels that exist for paper and environmental management systems in the sector. The economic impact of the pilots differed depending on the design changes that were introduced. In the two cases where the publishers or clients accepted design proposals, cost reductions were significant (29.1% or 60% reduction), while in the case where the design proposal was rejected and only printing changes were applied, the budget reduction decreased by 5% or 9%. Such results can be used to help counter misconceptions that eco-friendly means more expensive. Aware of the high transferability potential of the project results, the three beneficiaries have signed an agreement for the exploitation of the e-tool in the future: SIMPPLE will do the maintenance of the tool, Leitat will be the organisation that will verify and certify the labels produced and El Tinter will be a user doing the commercial dissemination. All the stakeholders will also continue to promote the project's Eco-publishing principles and will incorporate the criteria identified in the GREENING BOOKS project for their publications from now on.","LEITAT, Spain","El Tinter, Spain; SIMPPLE, Spain",C/ de la Innovació,8225,Terrassa (Barcelona),ES,41.5611,2.0081,,1262300400 to 1356994800,1262300400 to 1356994800,http://greeningbooks.eu/,"<a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=3739"">Project summary</a>",Sustainable Growth: Natural Resources,LIFE+,Environment & climate,"Jobs, Growth and Investment;Energy Union and Climate",361918,723837,DG ENV,English
3587,,First implementation of a new waste recovery technology converting MSW into synthetic diesel fuel,DEMONSTRATION OF KDV TECH,https://ec.europa.eu/budget/euprojects/sites/euprojects/files/life09_env_es_000484.jpg,"<p>The DEMONSTRATION OF KDV TECH project aimed to develop the first full-scale demonstration of catalytic depolymerisation technology for the processing of municipal solid waste (MSW) produced in Catalonia. The demonstration plant is capable of treating up to 30 000 tonnes/yr of mixed MSW and the catalytic depolymerisation technology converts mixed biodegradable MSW into a synthetic diesel, which can replace conventional diesel.</p>","The DEMONSTRATION OF KDV TECH project developed the first pilot plant with demonstrative capacity based on innovative DieselR technology. The DieselR process utilises a catalyst to break down long carbon chains (polymers) into shorter carbon chains that comprise a high-quality diesel fuel. The process represents a clean, quick and efficient treatment for biodegradable non-recyclable waste fractions of urban origin. The facility in Constantí has the capability of reducing the amount of urban waste sent to landfill by 40 000 tonnes/year and producing 15 000 tonnes tons/year of diesel fuel, which implies an annual reduction of 44 000 tonnes of CO2 emissions.The beneficiary successfully modified the available catalytic depolymerisation technology for the treatment of solid waste, in a way that overcomes the technical limitations of other solutions implemented to date. Built to be consistent with the guidelines of the Waste Framework Directive (2008/98/EC) and Directive 1999/31/EC, which requires Member States to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfill, the pilot facility has sufficient capacity to treat around 30 000 tonnes of mixed non-recyclable waste, equivalent to that generated by 180 000 inhabitants in an urban area. Griñó Ecologic S.A., the sole beneficiary, originally designed a progressive strategy in three stages to achieve the necessary modifications to an existing pilot plant. The first stage involved the fitting out of the existing plant to operate in continuous conditions, with a treatment capacity of 200 l/h. The beneficiary designed, as a second stage, a technological improvement plan to increase the treatment capacity to 900 l/h, while a third stage would see a second catalytic treatment unit added to bring the total treatment capacity to 1 800 l/h.The operating tests started in September 2012 using mineral oil, with a capacity of more than 200 l/h being achieved. However, due to problems with pipe blockages, the subsequent technological changes were made gradually so that they could be closely monitored and modified whenever necessary. By October 2013, modifications were made to increase performance to the maximum 1 800 l/h. With the current production capacity of the pilot plant and the operating levels achieved, a production of over 11 000 cubic metres of synthetic diesel fuel can be expected per year. During the modification stage, the beneficiary optimised the process by identifying the most suitable fluidisation liquids to be used, such as mineral oil or dried MARPOL residues, and by finding that the best results were obtained by using a mixture of crushed solid waste with a 25-40% of Solid Recovered Fuel (SRF) enriched with low density polyethylene. Several adjustments in the heat exchanger were carried out to stabilise the process and these have improved its performance. In addition, the beneficiary reduced the coking time and prolonged the running time in continuous conditions. The inerts treatment module currently operates under continuous conditions for no more than 14 days in a row, so further redesigning is necessary to allow the plant to work continuously for longer periods.Finally, aside from reducing 40 000 tonnes/year of urban waste that would otherwise end in landfills, the technology produces up to 15 000 tonnes/year of alternative fuel which implies a reduction of 44 000 tons of CO2, thus contributing to climate change mitigation and biofuel production (2009/28/EC Renewable Energy Directive). The project's programme for disseminating and communicating project results focused on the advantages of the new technology compared to currently used technologies, with regard to environmental issues, economic viability and social acceptance. During the project's implementation, more than 300 people (mainly from public authorities and private companies) visited the pilot facility.Diesel R technology has a huge potential in terms of replication in other municipal districts. The project has given this technology a definitive step towards its future application in 100% profitable and exploitable commercial facilities. The new technology has found a higher public acceptance than conventional waste management technologies, due to the absence of nuisance smells and particles. In addition, the final product of the process, an alternative diesel fuel, has quite good commercial acceptance.","Sanea Tratamiento de Residuos, S.L.U. - Griñó Group, Spain",,"C/Historiador J.

3588,,"Participatory monitoring, forecasting, control and impacts of eutrophication and algal blooms",GISBLOOM,https://ec.europa.eu/budget/euprojects/sites/euprojects/files/life09_env_fi_000569.jpg,<p>The GISBLOOM project built tools and capacity to ensure better integration of climate change adaptation into river basin management plans in Finland. It demonstrated an integrated model (Vesinetti ‘Waternet’) to quantify the effects of different climate change adaptation scenarios on eutrophication and algal blooms.</p>,"The project used an innovative combination of data from around Finland and an integrated WSFS-VEMALA-LAKESTATE model, which simulates hydrology, land-use changes and nutrient loads, to generate data and real-time forecasts for algal blooming in river basins and in around 48 000 Finnish lakes on a daily basis. The data used to forecast algal blooms comes from diverse sources, including MERIS satellite imagery, automatic measuring stations and field observations by the public. The model tools developed by the project informed the selection of measures for river basin management plans in eleven pilot areas. Implementation of these measures was subject to cost-benefit analyses. The demonstration of the project's developed and introduced models and methods in the pilot areas led to the identification of feasible and cost-efficient combinations of measures for river basin management in these areas. The project developed an innovative web-based map service, Vesinetti (www.vesinetti.fi), and an interactive portal called 'LakeWiki' (www.jarviwiki.fi). These services have facilitated the dissemination of information and viewpoints for educational purposes and participatory river basin management.Improved understanding of algal blooms and their responses to management measures in lakes and coastal areas gained through the project will help local authorities draft future river basin management plans. Through its activities, the GISBLOOM project contributed to the implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC), the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (2008/56/EC) and the Nitrates Directive. The project conducted a complete analysis of national data on hydrology, land use, nutrient loading, water quality, eutrophication and algal blooms, and an assessment of eutrophication and algal bloom scenarios as a function of climate and land use changes. The project's tools and web-based models have improved understanding of algal blooms and their responses to management measures in Finnish lakes and coastal areas. In lakes, for example, analysis provided nutrient load thresholds that could be monitored for management purposes to avoid cyanobacteria mass occurrences during summer. The models also proved to be useful tools for the ecological classification of lakes. Awareness about eutrophication and algal blooming has been raised, among the public and key stakeholder groups, as a result of the web-based tools and a range of dissemination activities.The project results were presented, for example, at a seminar for national stakeholders. Training courses and workshops were organised for experts and local people, respectively. The project has helped to facilitate the exchange of information between European projects and organisations that produce information for the implementation of Water Framework Directive programmes of measures. The improved efficiency of participatory monitoring and management of eutrophication and algal blooms will provide long-term environmental benefits. In addition, the improved understanding of casual linkages between land use and ecological status of waters will increase the motivation, preparedness and ability of the public to participate in the planning and implementation of measures to control algal blooms. Socio-economic benefits that arise from improved water quality include the creation of business opportunities, for example, for fishing tourism and industries requiring clean water. As a result of the extensive testing in several river basin pilot areas, the tools have been adopted by river basin management planners and stakeholders in public and private organisations. The Ministry of the Environment is exploring the commercialisation potential of the tools through the related consultancy service established in SYKE soon after the project ended. The tools developed by the project are readily transferred to other regions where water bodies are defined in GIS format.","Suomen ympäristökeskus, Finland","Arbonaut Oy, Finland; West Finland Regional Environment Centre, Finland; Päijät-Hämeen Vesijärvisäätiö Foundation, Finland; The Association for Water and Environment of Western Uusimaa, Finland; Tvärminne Zoological Station-University of Helsinki, Finland",Mechelininkatu 34a140,251,Helsinki,FI,60.179108,24.916216,,1262300400 to 1356994800,1262300400 to 1356994800,http://www.syke.fi/projects/gisbloom,"<a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=3719"">Project summary</a>",Sustainable Growth: Natural Resources,LIFE+,Environment & climate,"Jobs, Growth and Investment;Energy Union and Climate",1503638,3060856,DG ENV,English
3589,,Waste management options for greenhouse gases emissions control,WASTE-C-CONTROL,https://ec.europa.eu/budget/euprojects/sites/euprojects/files/life09_env_gr_000294.jpg,"<p>The WASTE-C-CONTROL project enabled to reduce GHG emissions by developing a software tool to assess, monitor, control and report on the emissions resulting from the entire life cycle of solid-waste management activities. The tool assess different waste-management options, which enabled the project to identify procedures and practical tools within Local Action Plans (LAPs) that reduce GHG emissions from waste-management activities at local level.</p>","The WASTE-C-CONTROL project developed a decision support software tool for monitoring GHG emissions from solid waste management activities during their whole life cycle. The software tool has assessed the entire range of the waste management practices, aimed to help authorities to identify best technological solutions with environmental and financial benefits as criteria at the local level. Alternative scenarios were developed for each one of the three participating regions (Eastern Macedonia and Thrace, Western Macedonia, and Chania) and the optimum one, in terms of both environmental and financial benefits, was selected for each region. Local Action Plans (LAPs), aiming to reduce GHG emissions from waste management activities at the local level, were developed on the basis of the results of the software tool's implementation.The following GHG emissions reductions were achieved within the project's lifetime:5 285 tonnes CO2 eq in Eastern Macedonia and Thrace;5 270 tonnes CO2 eq in Western Macedonia;1 269 tonnes CO2 eq in Chania.WASTE-C-CONTROL's software tool enabled local authorities, companies and other stakeholders to substantially reduce GHG emissions resulting from their waste management activities. The tool provides decision support for the optimisation of waste management practices using a simulation environment, where an existing or desired regional or local waste management system can be designed by the user. The innovative aspect of the tool is the incorporation of a function to calculate the optimal values for the decision variables. In addition, the project team developed the WASTE-C-CONTROL iOS application for mobile phones as a useful and simplified tool for local authorities and other stakeholders, and also as a dissemination tool. Each LAP set specific quantitative goals for reductions in GHG emissions, specified the means to attain the reductions, the relevant investments needed, and a suggested schedule for these investments.According to the WASTE-C-CONTROL software tool results, the anticipated GHG emissions reductions from the implementation of the LAPS over a 20-year period were 1 600 kilotonnes CO2 eq (65%) for Eastern Macedonia and Thrace; 192 kilotonnes CO2 eq (36%) for Western Macedonia; and 75 kilotonnes CO2 eq (18%) for Chania. LAP short-term measures, to reduce GHG emissions at local and sectoral level, implemented in Eastern Macedonia and Thrace included the supply of recycling equipment (4 000 blue bins, 35 waste collection trucks and 4 bag openers), with recycling bins sited in the cities of Drama and Xanthi. Municipal solid waste streams were monitored and weighed at household level, for eight households over five months in Rodopi (with assistance from a local ecology group); the results showed that 67% of this household waste could be recycled or composted (achieving an estimated emissions reduction of 1.53 tonnes CO2 eq). An awareness-raising 'recycling corner' was established by associated beneficiary DIAAMATH. The management of landfill gas at Kavala was improved through a monitoring programme and the installation of addition flares to burn off escaping methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2).In Chania, short-term LAP measures were organised by associated beneficiary DEDISA. These included the installation of new technology for sorting recyclables and the construction of transfer stations to reduce vehicle journeys. In Western Macedonia, associated beneficiary DIADYMA expanded the recycling programme, for example, with 4 900 new bins (to increase recovery of recyclables by 25%); purchased 14 waste collection vehicles; implemented an improved press system at the Kozani Transfer Station (with estimated emissions reduction of 3.31 tonnes CO2 eq); and purchased and installed ten biofilters, which reduced CH4 and CO2 emissions by 76% and 78.5%, respectively, in 2013.A number of information and public awareness activities were implemented through the LAPs in the three regions. These included the production of practical guidelines for waste-transfer station operators, the production public recycling guides, events for students and high school teachers, websites, and articles online and in printed media. Local authorities in the three regions have committed to continue the LAPs. These measures will help implement EU policies relating to solid waste management, packing and waste, and climate change and GHG emissions. A range of socio-economic benefits include savings resulting from increased recycling and composting rates, and the extended lifetime of existing landfills.","EPEM - Environmental Planning, Engineering and Management S.A., Greece","DEDAPAL-Inter-Municipal Enterprise for Waste Treatment and Environmental Development S.A., Greece; DIAMATH-Waste Management Authority of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace S.A., Greece; DEDISA-Trans-Municipal Enterprise of Solid Waste Management, Greece",Acharnon 141B,10446,Athens,EL,38.003461,23.727177,,1262300400 to 1325372400,1262300400 to 1325372400,http://www.epem.gr/waste-c-control,"<a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=3703"">Project summary</a>",Sustainable Growth: Natural Resources,LIFE+,Environment & climate,"Jobs, Growth and Investment;Energy Union and Climate",1003788,2363204,DG ENV,English
3590,,WaterIZe spatial planning: encompass future drinkwater management to adapt to climate change,WIZ,https://ec.europa.eu/budget/euprojects/sites/euprojects/files/life09_env_it_000056.jpg,<p>The overall goal of the WaterIZe 'WIZ' spatial planning project was to integrate the protection and sustainable management of water in urban planning processes and local policy areas. The project aimed to incorporate long term analysis of drinking water management in urban spatial planning by creating a platform for local authorities to be involved in decision-making processes.</p>,"The WIZ project developed and demonstrated an innovative approach to drinking water management, which takes into account the potential impacts of climate change. The project’s approach involves water resource allocation in relation to request trends and expected resource availability. This will facilitate the adaptions that will be needed to ensure future availability of water within informed urban planning decisions and - with regards to citizens - life choices. The WIZ project team developed an online platform that includes two services: WIZ4All and WIZ4Planners. Citizens can find information about current and future water availability for specific locations via the WIZ4All service. WIZ4Planners is a decision-support service for local authorities and other stakeholders concerned with territorial and urban planning. It provides information related to estimates of the needs and availability of clean water, with comparisons between settlement scenarios and climatic scenarios, and also gives estimates of the costs of the water supply infrastructures. The open-source code of the WIZ platform engine enables constant improvements to be made to the system.The WIZ project conducted an analysis of long-term management of drinking water, in a system where water management has been integrated into land use planning. The WIZ approach (in particular, WIZ4Planners) defined a decision process that integrates, firstly, the prediction model of the effects of climate change on the availability of water resources and, secondly, the spatial data provided by the municipalities involved in the demonstration of WIZ services. WIZ enables water authorities to prepare investment plans with a more complete picture and harmonised data characterising the water demands of an area. As a result of the project, awareness of water management issues and participation in water-related activities have increased among citizens and businesses. The online platform offers a range of freely-available information on water resources, making possible a 'participatory management' approach. Users can also contribute actively by reporting the perceived quality of drinking water and failures or other dysfunctions of service. This outcome contributed to the implementation of the Directive 2003/4/EC on public access to environmental information. Public involvement may put a greater focus on the value of drinking water and its quality, and encourages more sustainable patterns of consumption.The WIZ approach was introduced into the decision-making practices of ten pilot municipalities in Tuscany, Italy, and two in Galicia, Spain. These municipalities were involved in the definition of the online platform. During the project lifetime, about 11% of the water needs for the population residing in the demonstration areas was managed through the WIZ services. The Tuscany Water Authority (AIT) officially invited the Coordinating Beneficiary to promote the use of WIZ throughout the region; while in Spain, the approach is being extended to other municipalities. The demonstration of the WIZ approach in two different European contexts means that it should be easily replicable in other countries.WIZ increased transnational cooperation and the exchange of results between European projects. Moreover, the WIZ project collaborated with various organisations and participated in numerous events and initiatives at national and international level, for example, becoming part of the European WISE-RTD network (Water Knowledge Portal) and the Network of Sustainable Energy in A Coruña. WIZ has also been included among the projects CLIMATE – ADAPT (the European Platform on adaptation to climate change). The project supported the local implementation of the European Framework for Action on Adaptation to Climate Change and has contributed to the implementation at local level of the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC). In particular it has influenced the decision-making planning processes and has made an important contribution to the work of modification of the Tuscany Regional Law 1/2005 on Land Governance.","Acque SpA., Italy","Autorità di Bacino del Fiume Arno (ABARNO), Italy; Fundación Instituto Tecnológico de Galicia (FUNITG), Spain; Acque Ingegneria S.r.l.

This was achieved through a participatory multi-stakeholder approach, mainly involving policymakers (local, regional and national), compost producers, beach resort managers and agriculture companies, and the implementation of knowledge-gathering, pilot study, demonstration, training and dissemination activities. The project consolidated and assessed available knowledge about the management, monitoring and mapping of seagrass meadow residues and other stranded biomass around the Mediterranean. This involved gathering a large amount of data for an economic analysis, including dynamic and qualitative aspects of biomass accumulations, collecting methods employed, and the costs of removal and disposal.Posidonia meadow residues were collected, washed, cut-up in situ, and transported to five pilot sites, where physical, biological and chemical parameters were characterised, to help define best practice methods for low-impact residue removal and pre-processing. Two different pre-processing approaches (involving grinding and drying) were assessed; while, in parallel, three prototypes were designed and set up ('Rotative wash de-sanding prototype', 'Bio-grinder prototype' and the 'Dryer prototype'). Demonstrative activities at the pilot study sites included Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of the identified management system. The Dryer prototype was used to demonstrate the agronomic use of green compost from Posidonia residues in greenhouse cultivation or as soil amendment. The results of demonstrative tests also showed that seagrass residues could be reused as compost in a range of other applications (e.g. nursery production of horticultural plants, organic agricultural fertiliser, and as soil amendment for urban green areas).The project provided training for administrators and technicians of local authorities and private companies on the eco-sustainable management of stranded Posidonia. Specific outputs of the project included a database for information on beached biomass management and compost production processes, a map of Posidonia meadow locations, and a report on methodologies for monitoring these meadows and their residues. The project developed a DSS (Decision Support System) for the management and use of beached biomass residues ('software PRIME'), which enables the identification of best practice through a list of questions relating to the beaching phenomena. This software assesses and quantifies the collection, treatment, storage and transport phases related to the management of beached biomass. In addition, the project published national and international manuals for the recycling of beached biomass residues in coastal dune reclamation and restoration; guidelines for the valorisation of beached biomass residues that balance environmental protection with tourism; and the creation of a register of 78 technicians certified for the sustainable management of beached Posidonia residues.The project ideas have been taken up by interested stakeholders. For instance, at least three of the five industrial composting plants in Puglia are now engaged in the composting of Posidonia residues, while numerous municipalities and entrepreneurs have expressed interest in applying the strategies promoted by the project (in Puglia, Toscana, Sardinia and Sicilia). The reuse of Posidonia residues leads to a decrease in the costs for their disposal. More specifically, surveys have shown that in Italy 50% of beached biomass reaches landfills, with municipal authorities bearing all the costs (70-80 EUR/tonne), with an average expenditure of about EUR 140 000 annually. If, on the other hand, 50% of this is used for compost, the costs borne will be related only to transport. When considering the Regional Plan for Urban Waste Management (updated 2013), on average, the transport costs represent about 36% of the total costs spent by the provinces in the Puglia region. Choosing the compost alternative will thus help them save 65% of the costs related to beached biomass disposal. The project demonstrated that rather than being an environmental problem, integrated management can turn beached seagrass residues into a useful resource for agriculture.","Municipality of Mola di Bari, Italy","Eco-Logica srl, Italy; Tecoma srl, Italy; ISPA-CNR, Italy; Aseco SpA, Italy","Via Alcide De Gasperi, 137",70042,Mola di Bari,IT,41.0667,17.0833,,1262300400 to 1356994800,1262300400 to 1356994800,,"<a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=3694"">Project summary</a>",Sustainable Growth: Natural Resources,LIFE+,Environment & climate,"Jobs, Growth and Investment;Energy Union and Climate",568455,1152917,DG ENV,English
3592,,Waste Prevention and Reduction in the Chianti Territory,WASTE-LESS in CHIANTI,https://ec.europa.eu/budget/euprojects/sites/euprojects/files/life09_env_it_000068.jpg,"<p>The WASTELESS IN CHIANTI project aimed to contribute to European and national policies on waste prevention and sustainable consumption through the implementation and monitoring of an integrated waste prevention and reduction programme for Chianti in Florence. By selecting an internationally known district, the aim was to provide Member States with a model for the establishment of their own waste prevention programmes by December 2013 (as required by the EU Waste Framework Directive).</p>","The project developed a pilot strategy for waste prevention and sustainable waste management in a local community. The successfully applied approach was in line with EU and National policies on waste management. In fact, it reflected the waste management hierarchy established by EU Directive 2008/98/EC, which promotes prevention above preparation for reuse and recycling. The project thus provided a successful case study for its implementation of this policy at local level. The specific objective to implement the provincial waste prevention and reduction plan was reached. This plan aims to improve waste prevention and reduce shared and concrete actions; introduce management and incentives tools (collection schemes, accounting systems, collection fees, regulatory frameworks); and promote the use and marketing of recycled materials. All components have been implemented and will continue also after the end of the project since they are integral parts of the Provincial Plan for Waste Prevention and Reduction.The expected result to reduce final municipal waste sent to landfill or incineration by 15% in five years (2007-2012) in the project region was reached at the end of 2012, with a 28% reduction in waste sent to final disposal. From 2007 to 2013, a 17% reduction in municipal waste generation was also recorded in the pilot area, which implies a per capita waste reduction of 121 kg/inhabitant/year. Also with respect to 2010, the starting year of the project, the total waste generation decreased by 9%. Furthermore, the amount of unsorted waste sent to final disposal also decreased (by 40% with respect to 2007 and by 28% with respect to 2010) with subsequent further improvements in collection of separate waste also observed. The project approach, however, was resource intensive and time consuming due to the need to directly involve local stakeholders and citizens in the implementation of the project actions. This is a key aspect of the project. Strong commitment by the local authorities is required to promote the initiative. European and national authorities can benefit from the experiences gained in applying this integrated approach, as well as the good practices that were adopted by the project for strengthening and refining the legislative and programmatic framework related to waste. In addition, local authorities in each Member State can directly apply the project's strategies and tools for implementing a similar approach in their own territory.Moreover, the entire project can be considered a best practice for waste prevention and sustainable management, since the innovative and demonstrative character of the project relies mainly on the integrated project approach. The single project measures have already been implemented in many other territories. But the project has demonstrated the effectiveness of combining many different good practices in a comprehensive approach, characterised by the implementation of many concrete waste prevention actions through the active involvement of many different local stakeholders. This was accompanied by the revision of waste collection schemes and the related regulatory/charging framework from a waste prevention perspective, and by an extensive local communication campaign.The project, through the monitoring strategy and tool developed, also provides Member States with useful examples for identifying qualitative or quantitative benchmarks for waste prevention measures. EU legislation obliges Member States to monitor and assess progress made in prevention. Moreover, the project identified legislative barriers in Italy for implementing the project in particular for setting up reuse centres and waste collection charging systems based on the PAYT (pay as you throw) approach. During the project, these difficulties were discussed and shared with other beneficiaries of EU funded projects addressing waste management, as well as with other experts in the waste issue. In cooperation with other EU funded projects, the project team drafted a petition for legislative action on waste. The text of the petition is available for download (in Italian) at: www.lowaste.it/appello-normativo-rifiuti/. The petition identifies limits and legislative constraints on the waste issue and gathers feedback and possible solutions, deriving from direct experience.Two aspects of the project can be considered innovative:The introduction of a territorial 'waste-less' label in order to engage many different local stakeholders in the implementation of the waste prevention project strategy.The implementation of a waste collection scheme, based on the application of the e-gate technology for measuring the amount of undifferentiated waste individually produced by users accompanied by door-to-door collection for the recyclable materials.The latter, in particular, demonstrates that highly selective collection and recycling performances can be reached not only through the implementation of waste collection schemes entirely based on the door-to-door collection of all waste fractions, as already demonstrated in many national and European territories, but also through the collection of undifferentiated waste with an e-gate bin-based collection scheme. Such a scheme gives more flexibility to households for delivering waste.The project approach also provides several relevant local economic and social benefits to the pilot area:Cost savings for the local authorities for delivering waste collection services, thanks to the reduction of the amount of waste sent to final disposal and to the efficiency of the e-gate technology, combined with door-to-door collection for the recyclable materials, in delivering high performance waste collection services;Cost savings for households, but also for not domestic users, due to lower waste collection fees, thanks to the introduction of a PAYT approach, made possible by individual accounting of waste;Positive 'territorial marketing' effect for the economic activities (tourism facilities, cafés and restaurants, shops etc.) in the areas implementing the project approach, linked to the implementation and promotion of the 'waste-less' label, and consequently positive effects on employment.Finally, the project approach was chosen as one of the 'best practices' to be introduced by the MED Zero Waste Pro project (www.zerowastepro.eu/the-project/capitalisation), co-financed by the Med Programme.","Provincia di Firenze, Italy","Municipality of Barberino Val d’Elsa, Italy; Municipality of Tavarnelle Val di Pesa, Italy; Municipality of San Casciano Val di Pesa, Italy; Safi SpA, Italy; Ambiente Italia srl, Italy; Municipality of Greve in Chianti, Italy",Via Mercadante 42,50144,Firenze,IT,43.7833,11.25,,1262300400 to 1356994800,1262300400 to 1356994800,http://www.wasteless-in-chianti.it/,"<a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=3746"">Project summary</a>",Sustainable Growth: Natural Resources,LIFE+,Environment & climate,"Jobs, Growth and Investment;Energy Union and Climate",504671,1088218,DG ENV,English

3594,,Achieving good water QUality status in intensive Animal production areas,AQUA,https://ec.europa.eu/budget/euprojects/sites/euprojects/files/life09_env_it_000208.jpg,"<p>This project aimed to reduce water pollution from nutrients at river basin scale by optimising the use of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from livestock farms, thus reducing nutrient losses to water. This was achieved by reducing nitrogen in manure by lowering N inputs in feedstuffs and by improving the efficiency of fertilisation to maximise the effectiveness of nutrients.</p>","The AQUA project demonstrated how to significantly reduce the pollution of ground and surface water due to the dispersion of nutrients from agricultural sources (N and P), through the optimisation of their use in livestock farms. It managed to reduce the environmental impact of intensive farming and improve the use of resources, while maintaining farm productivity by increasing the efficiency of management practices. The project objectives were achieved through the integration of innovative technical and management practices implemented on a network of nine demonstration farms situated in Northern Italy (Piedmont, Lombardy, Emilia Romagna, Friuli Venezia Giulia and Veneto) in those areas where the agro-zoo-technical pressure is greater. Specifically, the project achieved the following results:Reduction of the nitrogen content in manure, through the application of low-protein rations for pigs and through more efficient nitrogen feeding – in pig farms, reductions of 15-20% in the excreted nitrogen and in nitrogen in the field (N present in the effluent at the time of distribution) were achieved; in dairy cattle farms, an average improvement in the nitrogen balance of 10% at farm level was recorded, while in beef cattle farms a reduction of 12% of the excreted nitrogen was achieved. The beneficiary calculates that the amount of nitrogen in the field that can be reduced on a national level is 14 383 tonnes/year, assuming that the dietary interventions are applied to the farms currently with a surplus of nutrients (i.e. 50% of the pig farms and 30% of the dairy and beef cattle farms).Increased fertilising efficiency of nutrients (N, P) contained in manure, through the application of innovative distribution techniques on crops characterised by long growing seasons and high nitrogen removal – the reduction of nitrogen excretion through dietary interventions and the improved efficiency of fertilisation has improved the nitrogen balances at all types farms: in pig farms it has been increased by 7-12% (depending on the farm) and in dairy cattle farms by up to 6-10%.Reduction of the loss of nutrients from land to water bodies through specific agri-environmental measures (buffer strips, wetlands) – the reduction amounts to 70% for nitrate nitrogen and 60% for total nitrogen within the first 5 m of the buffer zone (overall width of some 20 m).Reduction of the pressures and impacts in areas with a high density of livestock farming through the separation of manure solid fraction and its transfer out of the Nitrates Vulnerable Zones. A consortium of intensive livestock farms and farms without livestock, which was established in an area of high livestock density of Lombardy, handled more than 1 300 tonnes of manure solid fraction, demonstrating the technical and organisational feasibility of such a solution.Improvement and simplification of controls in farms, through the development of a tool for the traceability and certification of best practices in nutrient management, from the animal feed to the efficient use of effluents – the tool, 'Calcola N', reports the nitrogen excreted and the yield of nitrogen used in the stable or on a specific group of animals in production.The project underlined the fact that current legislation is sufficiently flexible to support the introduction of the practices identified during the project, but it would be still useful to simplify the existing mechanisms for those operators who are willing to adopt virtuous practices and to adhere to certification and control systems. The main message for policy makers is that it would be desirable to move from the current constraints set by the Nitrates Directive (91/676/EC) (fixed limits of nitrogen from manure per hectare, independently from the type of farm - cattle, pigs, poultry, etc. - and from the efficiency of the fertilisers used) to an 'efficiency requisite of the entire farm cycle', extending the performance requirements to the entire farm cycle and to all the nutrients (N and P) and possibly to other elements.The project results are also relevant for: The priority objectives of the 7th EAP (Decision N°1386/2013/EU), in particular with the Primary Objective 1) to protect, conserve and enhance the natural capital of the EU, with particular reference to the need to reduce the release of nutrients, improve cycle management of this release, encourage the efficient and sustainable use of resources, and improve the efficiency of fertiliser; The Water Framework Directive (WFD 2000/60/EC) as it helps to obtain the main aim foreseen by the directive of achieving good environmental status; The Marine Strategy Directive, which aims to create more efficient and sustainable cycle of nitrogen and phosphorus in the use of resources. The project also contributed to the implementation of the indications provided by the European Commission in COM (2011) 21 'Resource efficient Europe - Flagship initiative under the Europe 2020 Strategy' for development of investments in younger generations in order to strengthen and enhance their environmental awareness.The AQUA approach could easily be replicated in Italy and in rural areas in other European countries that are characterised by a high density of livestock farms. The techniques can be considered innovative, as the project tested the performance of slurry in different operating conditions, obtaining previously unavailable indications. The project also developed an innovative new instrument for the certification of techniques to reduce losses of N based on the monitoring and recording of activities, in order to ensure the traceability of inputs and outputs of proteins at farm level and the possible transfer of the manure solid fractions out of vulnerable zones. From a cost-benefit analysis, it was shown that an improved diet for livestock, through the balance of the nitrogen administered, allows savings on feed with high-protein content, aside from an improvement in the animals’ health. A reduction of administered medicines and an increase of fertility of cows have been recorded. As a direct economic consequence of the reduction of excreted nitrogen in farms showing a surplus of nitrogen, it is possible to reduce the cost of effluent management. Furthermore, the reduction of water pollution by nitrates from agricultural sources, connected to the application of good practices identified in the project, will improve the quality of drinking water and reduce the cost of treatment.The innovative practices proposed by the project were applied immediately in the nine demonstration farms (in particular, the use of diets with low-protein content and the agricultural practices with high efficiency of nitrogen use) and the application of these innovations is continuing, not for contractual obligations, but for the belief that the environmental benefit achieved does not entail any reduction in terms of production or increases in production costs. The demonstration farms are continuing to apply the project's practices. Furthermore, the results of the project were planned to be used in the review of the water management plans to update the programme of measures.Finally, the results related to the best practices for the effluent management tested in the project have been used during the project lifetime for the definition of the measures of the national Rural Development Programme (PSR), in particular for the regions of northern Italy, where the demonstrative farms are located, both with reference to measures recently funded for the last programming period 2007-2013, and for the next PSR programme 2014-2020, with the aim of promote virtuous practices aimed at increasing the nitrogen efficiency.","Centro Ricerche Produzioni Animali C.R.P.A.

3595,,Innovative Centrifugal Separator Technology for Energy Recovery and Oily Waste Volume Reduction,Pure Energy Separator,https://ec.europa.eu/budget/euprojects/sites/euprojects/files/life09_env_se_000352_0.jpg,"<p>The 'Pure Energy Separator' project demonstrated and evaluated an innovative continuous ejection technology, based on a method of expelling sludge from a separator. The system does not require any process water and therefore the sludge is concentrated and dry. The result shows that more than 90% of the waste oil can be reused. The volume of oil going for incineration is then reduced, which is in line with the objectives of the Directive for the Disposal of Waste Oils (75/439/EEC).</p>","The 'Pure Energy Separator' project developed, constructed and tested a total of twelve oil separator devices, which were installed and tested in marine vessels (twelve pieces), at the mechanical workshops of metal industry companies (three pieces) and at the beneficiary's test laboratory (one piece). All marine industry devices were found to work well, producing purified and recycled spill and engine oils that represented approximately 2% of the annual fuel consumption (in the region of 200-250 m3/yr) for large container/passenger vessels. Such results also reduced corresponding amounts of CO2 emissions.The beneficiary has actively disseminated the results and is developing them into a service package that is being marketed worldwide to the shipping industry. Direct environmental benefits flow from using the recycled spill oils (waste mainly from the ships’ own fuel and machinery) as ship fuel instead of virgin hydrocarbon fuel. Some 2% of the annual fuel consumption in an average (larger) vessel can be replaced with recycled oil. This presents CO2 reductions and reduces amounts of waste oil that is currently incinerated. Such an outcome is in line with the objectives of the Directive for the Disposal of Waste Oils (75/439/EEC).Devices for the mechanical industry functioned basically in the same way as in the marine industry. Interim results for this part of the project indicated similarly promising environmental benefits as the system developed for marine industry. However, handling waste oils (which possess much more varying characteristics than oil in vessels) proved not fully feasible during the project period and still requires further fine-tuning. Separation and purification results were good but wear-and-tear problems existed and these required regular changing of parts, which made the operation uneconomic. The beneficiary explains that there is a keen demand for these separation devices and is therefore actively continuing the development work after the LIFE supported stage.Also, the project yielded a lot of practical and useful new information for the beneficiary to use in the future. Innovative elements were noted throughout the project. For example, mobile oil purification systems installed in the test ships worked 'on-line', thereby avoiding waste oil transportation and disposal (except for tiny amounts of almost solid residues which are logistically easy to handle). The purification/separation system developed for the mechanical industry relies closely on the same principles as in the shipping industry (i.e. trying to avoid unnecessary transportation of oil and its incineration). The working principles of the developed system are simple and transparent which aids demonstration purposes. Overall project achievements are based on the beneficiary's very long experience with these types of technical solutions, and especially its ability to closely cooperate with new clients and markets (in this case with the shipping and mechanical industry).","Alfa Laval Tumba AB, Sweden",,Hans Stahles väg 7,147 80,Tumba,SE,59.2,17.8167,,1262300400 to 1356994800,1262300400 to 1356994800,http://www.alfalaval.com/puredry,"<a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=3713"">Project summary</a>",Sustainable Growth: Natural Resources,LIFE+,Environment & climate,"Jobs, Growth and Investment;Energy Union and Climate",1438989,3107979,DG ENV,English

3597,,Management of the invasive Raccoon Dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) in the north-European countries,MIRDINEC,https://ec.europa.eu/budget/euprojects/sites/euprojects/files/life09_nat_se_000344.jpg,"<p>The objectives of the MIRDINEC project focus on halting the loss of EU biodiversity, particularly in wetland areas, caused by the raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides). An early warning system will be established to track immigration of raccoon dogs and innovative culling/management methods will be applied to control the species.</p>","The MIRDINEC project achieved all its main objectives. It successfully instigated international cooperation to manage a highly mobile invasive alien species (IAS). This resulted in a slowing down of the dispersal of raccoon dogs from Finland to Sweden and Norway and a reduction in the existing population in Sweden and Norway. It also slowed down population dispersal in Denmark and prevented a rapid population increase. In doing so, the project contributed to the objectives of the Rio Convention on Biological Diversity, the Bern and Ramsar conventions and the Commission Communication: 'Halting the loss of Biodiversity by 2010 – and beyond'.As planned, the project established an early warning system (EWS) in Sweden, Denmark and Finland. This has provided early warnings of the presence of raccoon dogs along the major immigration routes into Sweden and Denmark. The project's awareness-raising initiatives amongst the hunting community and the general public contributed greatly to the success of the EWS. These included developing citizen science systems in Sweden and Denmark that allow hunters and the wider public to report sightings of raccoon dogs. More than half the raccoon dogs eradicated have been culled thanks to these reports. The project improved methods of raccoon dog capture and demonstrated the potential transfer of innovative methods to other invasive species with similar behaviour, such as raccoons (Procyon lotor). Captured males and females in Sweden and Denmark were sterilised, tagged and tracked (using GPS/VHF transmitters).Raccoon dogs are strictly monogamous, forming 'life partnerships' with their mate. This trait allowed the project to track the so-called 'Judas' animal and thus capture its partner (and any offspring) – this was the first time that the Judas animal technique has been used on an invasive alien predator. To encourage transfer of its innovative methods, the project hosted a LIFE Platform Meeting on Invasive Alien Predators, which disseminated MIRDINEC's results to an international audience of species management specialists, scientists and policy-makers. In total, the project received 3 234 reported observations of raccoon dogs in Denmark and Sweden, of which 852 were confirmed by the project team. Over the three years of the project, a total of 1 401 raccoon dogs were captured and/or killed in Finland, Sweden and Denmark (this includes those culled by the project, by hunters, those killed by traffic and those found dead). Some 170 of the captured animals were used as Judas animals.The project developed population models which show that without its efforts, raccoon dog populations would be significantly larger than at present. Without the continuous management of the species, the number of racoon dogs in Sweden and Denmark would reach critical levels for native biodiversity in the next 10-20 years. This shows that although costs associated with management of invasive alien species are substantial, the cost of management (predator control) of valuable wetlands (bird recruitment areas) when invasive alien predator species have established themselves are even higher. Recognising this, as a result of the LIFE project, authorities in Sweden, Norway and Denmark have allocated short-term financing for the joint continued management of the raccoon dog, whilst Finland is in the process of doing so. Suggested indicators for monitoring the long-term impact of the project include:The extent and effectiveness of the early warning system in Sweden and Denmark.The continued commitment from the state authorities on financing further prevention/eradication of the racoon dog in the four participating countries (Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway).The extent of involvement of the public (hunters) in eradication of the racoon dog.Whether or not the Judas animal technique has been applied in other countries and/or for other species.","Swedish Association for Hunting and Wildlife Management, Sweden","Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, Sweden; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Sweden; Finnish Wildlife Agency, Finland; Danish Nature Agency, Denmark",Öster-Malma,611 91,Nyköping,SE,58.75,17,,1262300400 to 1356994800,1262300400 to 1356994800,http://jagareforbundet.se/vilt/Mardhundsprojektet/,"<a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=3784"">Project summary</a>",Sustainable Growth: Natural Resources,LIFE+,Environment & climate,"Jobs, Growth and Investment;Energy Union and Climate",2659139,5318278,DG ENV,English

The project used a standardised JRC fuel-type classification scheme for European forest regions, and its FCMs (resolution 250mx250m for 42 types of fuels [250x250x42]). Based on the JRC classification, ArcFUEL developed an 'add-on' methodology and workflow (with the use of freely available European spatial datasets and Landsat TM images) for the production of FCMs. This methodology was then tested and demonstrated in four Mediterranean countries, which led to FCMs being developed for Greece and Portugal at national scale and Italy (Calabria and Sardinia) and Spain (Malaga, Cordoba). The quality of the mapping was validated against field data. Stakeholder inputs helped the methodology's development and associated workflow. Field visits (Ground Truth Surveys) were performed at the pilot areas to verify / validate the results of the methodology. Approximately 670 plots were sampled in the different pilot regions of Greece, Portugal, Italy and Spain. A geodatabase was developed and is available on the project website (www.arcfuel.eu). It includes results of the Ground Truth Surveys and the new FCMs for the pilot areas.ArcFUEL's methodology proved to be a comprehensive method for rapid classification of forest vegetation into fuel types, delivering relevant input layers for fire modelling at an appropriate spatial resolution, using freely available data. Any future update of the input maps used in the ArcFUEL project will strongly improve the accuracy of the forest fuel maps. This innovation put into practice, tested and standardised a production chain for FCMs. Methods and techniques applied in the production chain come from the Remote Sensing and Forest Management fields. Forest Classification has thus been applied for the first time at such a wide scale (all of Greece and Portugal, as well as regions of Spain and Italy) and with such a resolution. These project achievements consolidate existing FCM methods and techniques and help to make them useful for the first time at this geographic level. During the project, the database was accessible to the project beneficiaries and it is now available for registered users to study and download.As foreseen in the proposal, the tool is available for a nominal fee and these funds are used to finance the geoportal's overhead costs until 2020. Project results were presented to interested stakeholders during the final workshop of the project. A mobile (Android) application was developed - freely available on the project website. Many other dissemination activities were implemented and recorded via the website. These include more than 40 articles being published in daily newspapers and the web, which considerably exceeded the anticipated media coverage. Project work was also promoted during INSPIRE conferences and workshops. High level contributions from the project relate to EU environmental policy covering forest fire management such as Council Decision 5/5/2007 - 2007/162/EC and Communication COM (2009) 82 Final, 23.2.2009.","Epsilon International SA, Greece","Aristotelion University Thessaloniki, Greece; Epsilon Italia slr, Italy; Associação para o Desenvolvimento da Aerodinâmica Industrial, Portugal; GMV Aerospace & Defence SA, Spain; Algosystems SA, Greece",Monemvasias 27,15125,Marousi,EL,38.033534,23.810189,,1293836400 to 1356994800,1293836400 to 1356994800,,"<a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=3976"">Project summary</a>",Sustainable Growth: Natural Resources,LIFE+,Environment & climate,"Jobs, Growth and Investment;Energy Union and Climate",652932,1305865,DG ENV,English
3600,,LOcal Waste Market for second life products,LOWaste,https://ec.europa.eu/budget/euprojects/sites/euprojects/files/life10_env_it_000373.jpg,"<p>Some 3 billion tonnes of waste are thrown away in the EU every year. The LOWaste project tackled this problem by developing local markets in Ferrara, Italy, to recycle or reuse textiles, inert building waste, urban furnishings, play equipment and food residues. This reduced waste production in the district by up to 11 400 tonnes per year.</p>","The LOWaste project achieved its objectives by establishing and consolidating markets for four 're-products' (i.e. products deriving from recovered wastes) and putting down solid bases for three additional markets (reuse centres, plastics, and inerts for building). However, its main overarching achievement was inspiring the creation of a local green district, based on circular economy principles, consisting of waste operators, small reuse and recycling platforms, artisans and SMEs engaged in the development, and manufactures of products from recovered materials. The ongoing activities of this green district will consolidate the waste management approach developed during the project. Local markets for recycled or reused material were established, both on the supply and demand side, to reduce urban waste. The project beneficiaries set up four consolidated 're-products' markets, for textiles, inert building waste (i.e. waste that will not decompose), urban furnishings and play equipment, and food residues.Textiles were recycled to produce a range of goods, including shoes, bags, furniture coverings and toys. Inerts recovered from the building sector (e.g. sand and bricks) were used as base material for roads, or mixed with cement in prototype panelling produced by a private sector building company. Urban furnishings and play equipment was refurbished or used for spare-parts storage. Food residues were collected in a local school and treated in a demonstration composter that accelerated their transformation into compost, which was reused directly in the school garden. The associated beneficiary Città Verde is continuing with inert waste recycling, street furniture and play equipment recovery, and food waste composting. Within the project's green district, these four 're-products' markets generated a series of environmental benefits, including direct waste reductions of up to 11 400 tons per year (in a district with a 350 000 population); indirect resource savings due to the use of secondary raw materials of around 11 200 tons of raw materials per year; estimated reductions of up to 3 000 tons of CO2 per year arising from non-disposal of wastes and the use of secondary raw materials; and a reduced water footprint of more than 230 000 cubic meters.The project partners also designed a reuse centre for Ferrara, where both private citizens and companies can dispose of items for eventual repair. The coordinating beneficiary, the Municipality of Ferrara, developed a green procurement programme that linked buying procedures to the eco-design of products. Following the results of tests, for example, the municipality council approved a regulation that obliged the use of recycled materials for road construction and maintenance; this regulation has been fully operative since December 2013. LOWaste encouraged the recovery of waste and the use of recovered materials by developing a wide and effective communication strategy, centring on three LOWaste events and the 'LOWaste for action' initiative. This initiative connected 58 selected actors, including designers, manufacturers and sales networks; 13 prototypes of re-products were suggested. All project beneficiaries and several local stakeholders signed the 'LOWaste agreement' as a commitment to pursue the project's long-term goal of creating a circular economy. The aim is to strengthen existing supply chains and encourage the emergence of new ones for recycling and reuse, to create a more resilient LOWaste district.The LOWaste project had significant EU environmental policy and legislation implications. In particular, the project results are coherent with the EU Thematic Strategy on the prevention and recycling of waste (COM (2005) 666 final and Directive 2008/98/EC). The project focuses on turning waste into a resource and phasing out wasteful practices like landfilling. Therefore, the project supports the 2014 EU Communication 'Towards a circular economy: a zero waste programme for Europe'. At national level, LOWaste, in alliance with other EU-funded waste management projects, presented to the Italian government a plea for environmental regulation reform, in order to overcome some of the existing legislative barriers slowing the waste reuse and recycling sector. The project demonstrated that both local waste production and the use of raw materials can be reduced by developing a local market for second life products. The creation of areas like the LOWaste district can also lead to increased local employment, involve social cooperatives and disadvantaged people, and help the emergence of new forms of entrepreneurship and eco-sustainable innovation.","Municipality of Ferrara, Italy","HERA S.P.A., Italy; Reuse and Recycling European Union Social Enterprises, Belgium; La Città Verde Società Cooperative Sociale ARL, Italy; IMPRONTA ETICA, Italy","PIAZZA MUNICIPALE, 2",44121,Ferrara,IT,44.8333,11.6167,,1293836400 to 1388530800,1293836400 to 1388530800,http://www.lowaste.it/,"<a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=3935"">Project summary</a>",Sustainable Growth: Natural Resources,LIFE+,Environment & climate,"Jobs, Growth and Investment;Energy Union and Climate",554500,1109000,DG ENV,English
3601,,Promoting sustainable salmon fishing practices on Lake Saimaa,Saimaan lohikalojen,https://ec.europa.eu/budget/euprojects/sites/euprojects/files/life10_inf_fi_000052.jpg,"<p>Lake Saimaa in Finland hosts landlocked and threatened salmon, brown trout, Arctic char and grayling populations. The Saimaan lohikalojen project prepared 60 fishing plans for fishery districts and joint ownership associations, which significantly advanced sustainable fishing in the Vuoksi River basin. It has raised awareness among anglers and improved management practices, particularly for valuable salmon populations.</p>","During the project, research information, species-specific strategies and management plans were adapted to a more easy-to-understand form (both visually and in terms of their content). The project provided updated and standardised information on the status and problems of endangered salmon in Saimaa for regional authorities, decision-makers in the local fisheries sector, fishing industry advisory bodies, fishing organisations and the fishing population. The project created tools for improving the effectiveness of, and expanding the management of, endangered salmon populations in Saimaa. LIFE support was used to emphasise the role of individual fishers in reviving endangered fish stocks and encouraged fishers to comply with fishing restrictions.Analysis of the before-and-after attitude surveys among fishers that were carried out by the project indicated that awareness about salmon issues is increasing (e.g. more appreciation of the protection measures for land-locked salmon, as well as raised awareness about methods for protecting the salmon, such as fishing restrictions). A key socio-economic outcome has shown the fishers that they are no longer 'lonely actors' and that their operations are being complemented by other stakeholders as well. Project meetings and events facilitated useful dialogue that led to innovative ideas, new solutions and practices. One concrete action with demonstration value was a 'lure design competition' (2012), which sought to optimise the sustainability of lures for salmon fishing.Other project actions produced a significant amount of communication material that is available at the website www.jarvilohi.fi. The project participated in dozens of fairs and exhibitions, trolling competitions, and fish markets, as well as several seminars and discussion events that were organised for fishers. The project also achieved broad media exposure. Timing of the project was opportune and linked well with important changes in the Finnish fisheries sector following, for example, reform of the national Fishing Act. The project aimed to influence issues in the new Fishing Act concerning migrating fish by commenting on those issues at several events and forums and by preparing statements for policy purposes. Meetings organised by the project and the preparation of the action plans can together be considered as a successful whole. Similar activities could be considered in other fishing regions in Finland and, since the organisation of fishing is an on-going process, similar projects would need to be undertaken to support the work of authorities in the Vuoksi River basin in Eastern Finland in the future as well.The sustainability of this kind of LIFE information and awareness raising projects depends on the activities being carried out after the project. The people and target groups need continuous reminders on the importance of the issues. hence, the beneficiaries have plans to continue the awareness raising and integrate it within their routine activities.","Pohjois-Karjalan elinkeino-, liikenne- ja ympäristökeskus, Finland","Etelä-Savon elinkeino-, liikenne- ja ympäristökeskus, Finland; Pohjois-Savon elinkeino-, liikenne- ja ympäristökeskus, Finland; Kaakkois-Suomen elinkeino-, liikenne- ja ympäristökeskus, Finland",Kauppakatu 40BPL 69,80101,Joensuu,FI,62.606435,29.766487,,1293836400 to 1388530800,1293836400 to 1388530800,http://www.jarvilohi.fi/fi/etusivu/,"<a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=4033"">Project summary</a>",Sustainable Growth: Natural Resources,LIFE+,Environment & climate,"Jobs, Growth and Investment;Energy Union and Climate",180635,361670,DG ENV,English

The reconstruction of the degraded banks of the lakes not only helped to stop the infiltration of pollutants from storm water, but also increased the landscape value of the lakes. This project was a major step forward in terms of fulfilling the requirements of the EU Water Framework Directive in relation to maintaining inland sources of surface water in 'good ecological condition'.</p>","The main objective of the 'Lake recult. in Gniezno' project was met: the quality of water improved substantially, and it is now possible to use the lakes for recreational activities. The reconstruction of the degraded lake banks not only secures the lake against infiltration of pollutants from storm water but also increased the landscape value of the lakes.The project also achieved the following specific results:Total phosphorus content in the water decreased to 0.047 mg P/dm3 in Winiary lake and 0.113 mg P/dm3 in Jelonek lake (the planned content was 0.1 - 0.2 mg P/dm3).The water transparency increased: visibility of Secchi's disc is 0.9 m in Jelonek lake and 2.9 m in Winiary lake (the planned value was 0.6 - 1.0 m).The content of chlorophyll was reduced to 11.4 ppm in Winiary lake and to 51.5 ppm in Jelonek lake (the planned value was 15 ppm) in 2010 and to 19.8 ppm in 2011 (one year after the end of the project).Blue-green algae have not been observed since inactivation of the phosphorus in bottom sediments (as planned).The project demonstrated that the method of inactivation of phosphorus by application of coagulants directly to bottom sediments is an effective tool for the protection of shallow lakes, especially those located in cities and urban areas. It is a relatively cheap method that makes progress in a short period of time. The results of the project were publicised through press articles (local and national), TV coverage, school visits, posters and the construction of four noticeboards at the project sites. In addition, a national conference was held. The project beneficiary recognises that the permanent monitoring of the lakes and their draining areas is necessary.Moreover, the beneficiary intends to implement the active conservation measures: Seasonal elimination of reeds from the area of inflow to the Jelonek lake, which will take the biogenous stored in the reeds out in the lake; Control of the fish stock, control catch of the selected fish species, which which will ensure a wide diversity of fish species; Controlled mowing of water plants from the sites around the lakes devoted to recreation; Control of macrophytes and their plantation if needed; Campaign to prevent feeding of aquatic birds. Finally, the project was a major step towards fulfilling the requirements of the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC). Among other goals, the directive aims to maintain inland sources of surface water in 'good ecological condition'.

From the data obtained, general environmental performance indicators related to the production process were calculated. Specific environmental performance indicators for the 12 BATs studied were also determined. From the data obtained general and specific environmental performance indicators were calculated for the 12 BATs studied:Heat-insulation of pipes and stenters;Segregation of hot and cold waste water streams and recovery of heat from the hot stream;Installation of automated dosing and dispensing systems which measure out the exact amount of chemicals and auxiliary required and deliver them directly to various machines through pipework without human contact;Installation of automated dosing and dispensing systems which meter the exact amount of dyes required (only foreseen for manual operations for dyes that are used infrequently;Recovery and reuse of sizing agents by ultrafiltration;Enzyme treatment;Recovery and reuse of alkali from mercerising rinsing water;Minimising volume capacity of the dip when using pad dyeing techniques, in continuous dyeing processes;Reusing rinse water;Reducing water consumption in printing cleaning operations;Minimising energy consumption in stenter frames by installing heat recovery systems;Elimination of bleaching in dark colours dyeing.These data served as a basis for the definition of the economic model, as well as for the development of the webtool and the manual. The tools allow different scenarios to be simulated to test a wide range of process variables and quantify the benefits of implementing a given BAT using the company's data processes and/or reference values. A BAT implementation study allowed participating companies to check, in loco, whether their application is resulting in economic and environmental benefits, namely reductions in water consumption costs, the production and concentration of wastewater, chemical consumption, and operating time, among others.The decision support methodology proposed by the project is, therefore, an added value for companies, since it produces immediate results by calculating the environmental and economic benefits of BAT implementation. A conduct code was also implemented by the beneficiaries to reduce CO2 emissions associated with the project, based on a set of procedures and good practices. During the entire project, the partnership was able to offset ten tonnes of CO2. The methodologies and tools developed in the scope of the project can easily be transferred to other companies of the textile sector all around the world. In addition, project results can also be an important contribution to the revision of BREF for the textile industry.","Centro Technologico das Industrias Têxtil e do Vestuàrio de Portugal, Portugal","ATP, Portugal; APA (Government Agency for the Environment), Portugal; UM, Portugal","Quinta da Maia - Rua Fernando Mesquita, 2785",P-4760-034,Vila Nova de Famalicão,PT,41.412099,-8.510019,,1230764400 to 1293836400,1230764400 to 1293836400,http://www.citeve.pt/batinloko,"<a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=3270"">Project summary</a>",Sustainable Growth: Natural Resources,LIFE+,Environment & climate,"Jobs, Growth and Investment;Energy Union and Climate",152752,311955,DG ENV,English
3606,,Demonstration of a process to recycle glas fibre waste producing Polypropilene composites,WGF-PP,https://ec.europa.eu/budget/euprojects/sites/euprojects/files/life07_env_e_000802.jpg,"<p>The WGF-PP project demonstrated, on a semi-industrial scale, an innovative recycling process to recycle glass fibre waste coming from glass fibre production, for use in reinforcing thermoplastics. The project first designed and constructed a plant that allowed the technical and economic feasibility to be evaluated before its application on a larger scale. The plant proved the technical viability and produced several final products that were validated by potential users.</p>","The WGF-PP project can be considered as a starting point for reducing the landfilling of fibreglass waste in the EU. The project has helped to reduce the environmental impact of this waste in landfills. In terms of resource efficiency, it also avoids the production of new fibreglass and thus the consumption of primary raw materials, it produces energy savings and consequently, the reduction of CO2 emitted to the atmosphere. The technology applied is able to introduce fibreglass wastes by using a 90 litre mixer where different types of material can be added, i.e. waste of fibreglass, polypropylene, additives, dyes. The use of non-virgin fibreglass or other material would not be possible in the classic production system as it would be broken when the extrusion or not well mixed, producing a non-acceptable product. The final product, recycled glass fibre reinforced plastics granules, have the necessary properties for specific applications in the automotive and appliance sectors. Rather than sending waste fibreglass to landfills, this project provided a solution to introduce it again to the market, as part of a plastic compound or composite. The process also allows to recycle of reinforced plastics wastes coming from ELV's (End of Life Vehicles).The project benefits the environment by reducing the amount of energy-consuming fibreglass consumption/production. Around 17 GJ are needed for the production of one tonne of fibreglass. In Europe, fibreglass producers dump 150 000 tonnes of waste (10% of its production); recycling this waste will produce 500 000 tonnes of reinforced materials and save 2.5 million GJ. Such a result translates to a saving of 1.46 tonnes of CO2 emission for every tonne of recycled fibreglass. Specifically, the plant constructed in this project will reduce the emission of CO2 by 2 920 tonnes a year.","Befesa Plásticos S.L., Spain",,"P.I. Parque de Alhama.

An important aspect of the project was the qualification and further training for those interested in marine aquaculture. To this end a wide range of dissemination activities, training programmes and public events were successfully carried out.For example, a list of all eco-labels in the field of fish and seafood, which presently can be found in Germany was compiled and during the 'TAK' events an educational game on buying behaviour and consumption patterns in relation to fish and seafood was presented. On the same occasion a lecture entitled 'Fish on the table - but which?' was held. It showed the differences between conventional and sustainable aquaculture and educated the audience on the variety of different eco-labels on the market.Another event was the Kiel 'Tag am Kai' (Day on the quayside), a sustainable aquaculture public event, which has become an annual street festival with training sessions and exhibitions. Furthermore, a committee bringing together stakeholders in the aquaculture sector was created by the project. The committee will continue its activities after the project end date, under the association, 'Bundesverband Aquakultur' (Federal Association of Aquaculture), which was founded in October 2011 as a consequence of the project.

3609,,Towards sustainable value chains through a common approach for company strategic work and operations,TOSCA,https://ec.europa.eu/budget/euprojects/sites/euprojects/files/life07_env_s_000912.jpg,"<p>The TOSCA project made an important contribution to increasing awareness, and the availability of tools, on how to enhance sustainability along the industry value chain. The project disseminated methodologies, strategies and awareness raising material to many companies.</p>","The TOSCA project undertook initial research on the current practices within the partner companies. This covered tools used to support sustainability and different systems for handling and managing data within an organisation. It also examined the inclusion of social aspects into appropriate tools and data management. This enabled it to deliver reports of analysis and recommendations on tools and data management systems for sustainable development. The approach was partly built on the tools demonstrated in the DANTES project (LIFE02 ENV/S/000351) previously funded by LIFE with the objective of using these developed tools into the wider context of sustainable development.Complementary work focused on communication, examining existing structures and practices for communication within the partner companies and between the companies and the rest of the value chain. The project examined state-of-the-art in models for communication within larger companies and value chains and provided recommendations for improved communication within companies and within a value chain. TOSCA examined current practices for developing and implementing sustainable development strategies in companies, specifically procedures for defining company core values and policies and how these are implemented, monitored and followed up. It also researched best practice models for working towards sustainable development and success stories from the implementation of such models.The research led to the production of a framework of working procedures and tools for sustainable development. This importantly helps provide a common language, shared definitions and general information exchange on sustainability. As well as being implemented in the partner countries, the project and framework were introduced to about 2 500 external people through conferences, workshops and seminars. The project successfully demonstrated that a process covering sustainability in value chains extended both upstream and downstream can be integrated into the business practices of large companies. A key message is that sustainability issues can be discussed very openly with several players in the value chain, requiring the active involvement of suppliers and client organisations. Good sustainability practice can be used increasingly as a marketing tool.Although the project did not deliver tangible environmental benefits during its lifetime, it can expect in the longer-term to positively influence companies' policies and practices around issues such as the purchase of raw materials, selection of suppliers and transportation arrangements. The partner, the Technical University of Chalmers is integrating learning from the project in its academic curricula on business and industrial topics.","Akzo Nobel Surface Chemistry AB, Sweden","SCA Hygiene Products AB, Sweden; Chalmers Tekniska HögskoIa, Sweden",Oestra Koepmangatan 6,S-44 85,Stenungsund,SE,58.068136,11.829337,,1230764400 to 1293836400,1230764400 to 1293836400,http://www.tosca-life.info/,"<a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=3309"">Project summary</a>",Sustainable Growth: Natural Resources,LIFE+,Environment & climate,"Jobs, Growth and Investment;Energy Union and Climate",1026999,2053998,DG ENV,English

It made an important contribution to improving the teaching of environmental issues and promoting a more balanced and practical view of the challenges and possible actions to be taken to address them.</p>,"The project developed and produced training material and arranged training for nearly 30 000 teachers and other school staff. The project also reached more than 600 stakeholders mainly comprising municipal school administrations, teachers' organisations and environmental interest groups. Information on web conferences and web-based material was sent to all headmasters. The training and information focused on how to integrate environmental issues into the school curricula. The project set up a nationwide network of coordinators to deliver this work and to promote the issues beyond the project. The project delivered:305 'Step One EU environmental policy courses' involving around 7 000 teachers in 210 municipalities (out of 290 in Sweden);870 'Step Two courses' - a shorter version of step one – involving 14 500 teachers and based on course material provided to the regional coordinators;40 lectures and seminars at educational fairs – mainly presenting teaching aids;Three films on the policy courses and how to use Eco-Schools as a tool to implement EU environment policy;Five conferences for around 30 regional coordinators;110 networking meetings between a total of nearly 3 000 teachers and 1 000 schools – organised by 16 regional coordinator schools;Quarterly newsletters to schools, regional coordinators and international partners;A European networking conference with representatives from ten EU countries and Norway.The project contributed to 1 200 schools and pre-schools joining the Swedish Eco-Schools programme, which is run independently of the LIFE project by the beneficiary. The results of the project will also be used to promote the Green Flag environmental certification system. The results of the project have been made available to a large number of stakeholders. The project website is a popular media to pass the message further and contains the teaching and information materials produced by the project. As an ultimate impact the beneficiary estimates that nearly 350 000 school children would be reached by the project's actions and better informed and educated about issues related to EU environmental policy. This number is calculated from the schools, administrators and teachers in the loop of the project. Long term environmental benefits can be expected from the increased knowledge and awareness.","Stifelsen Håll Sverige Rent - The Keep Sweden Tidy Foundation, Sweden",,Högbergsgatan 444155,SE-102 64,Stockholm,SE,59.315472,18.062758,,1230764400 to 1293836400,1230764400 to 1293836400,http://www.hsr.se,"<a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=3310"">Project summary</a>",Sustainable Growth: Natural Resources,LIFE+,Environment & climate,"Jobs, Growth and Investment;Energy Union and Climate",1261397,2534643,DG ENV,English

Another key achievement of the LIFE project has been its legacy that continues to see the mainstreaming of EWWR actions by Member States after the LIFE funding period finished.An evaluation of the project observed that around two million people participated in the EWWR during 2011. Waste reduction activities increased from 2 672 activities in 2009 to 7 035 in 2011. A total of 14 053 different activities were affiliated with the EWWR during its three year term. These included for example, LIFE co-finance being used in Italy to host a high profile EWWR conference, which proved beneficial in helping to enhance monitoring systems for waste-related policy actions.Portugal organised training courses to raise awareness about waste reduction and the courses created multiplier effects by encouraging new stakeholders to become involved in setting up their own EWWR actions. An inventory of the policies and stakeholders of waste prevention in Europe published in 2010 gave an overview of the waste prevention situation in each country. An interesting and useful guide to EWWR good practices was published at the end of the project. These drew on results from the project's three EWWR award schemes, which were organised to encourage and acknowledge good practice approaches in waste reduction that could be replicated elsewhere. Some 30 awards were made and Catalonia was given a special prize in recognition of its ongoing commitment to innovative EWWR approaches.Lessons learnt from the project point to a need to strengthen the EWWR's ability to measure its positive impacts. Anecdotal evidence suggested that waste production did decrease in some countries during the project period. However, a consensus among EWWR activists underlined the need to better understand how to accurately assess the role that information projects and communication campaigns can play in changing consumption patterns. Other challenges identified to overcome as the project continues to be mainstreamed include improving media coverage and identifying optimum timing for future EWWRs.","Agence de l'Environnement et de la Maîtrise de l'Energie, France","ARC, Spain; ACR+, Belgium; IBGE-BIM, Belgium; Lipor, Portugal",Avenue du Grésillé 20 BP 90406,F-49004,Angers Cedex 01,FR,47.457885,-0.602823,,1230764400 to 1293836400,1230764400 to 1293836400,http://www.ewwr.eu,"<a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=3317"">Project summary</a>",Sustainable Growth: Natural Resources,LIFE+,Environment & climate,"Jobs, Growth and Investment;Energy Union and Climate",1073317,2146633,DG ENV,English
3612,,From Roof to Road - Innovative recycling of bitumen felt roofing material,From Roof to Road,https://ec.europa.eu/budget/euprojects/sites/euprojects/files/life07_env_dk_000102.jpg,<p>The 'From Roof to Road' project succeeded in demonstrating that the bitumen in waste roofing felt could be reused in asphalt for road construction and repair.</p>,"The project team was able to establish a collections system for roof-felt waste, process and grind the waste into grades suitable for re-use and to apply this in asphalt for road and infrastructure constructions. After conducting an updated overview of the technological and legislative state-of-play with regards to bitumen recycling, the project created a basic network of material collection sites. These were run by third parties and combined collection and recycling also of other waste streams. The project saw the collection of 1 000 tonnes of roof felt waste during its lifetime. All the waste collected during the project was recycled, using an innovative mobile recycling machine designed by the project. An important lesson was that the success of the process was highly weather/temperature dependent. Too cold temperatures in winter resulted in stiff or frozen roof felt which could not easily be processed, whilst too much heat in the summer caused some of the bitumen to become increasingly liquid and sticky in the shredding process. Approximately 60% of the total weight of felt roofing waste collected during the project was extracted as a reusable bitumen aggregate containing small uniform grain (grit) of up to 8 mm.The project partner NCC Roads tested the product in its laboratories and applied it in ten on-site test mixes. This work demonstrated that the recycled bitumen can be successfully used for most grades of asphalt and can pass all necessary certifications except for use on airport runways. Following the successful experiences and learning, the project designed and ordered a 'second generation' stationary version of the machinery for a fixed indoor site in Herning. This machine was complemented by a post-sorting device and sufficient storage capacity for collected waste and extracted materials. It should have an annual capacity of 10 000 tonnes per year, equating to 25% of annual Danish roofing waste generation. The beneficiary worked to ensure the long-term viability of the new process. It obtained all the necessary approvals and certifications, ensuring that the recycling process complies with national and EU standards.The beneficiary worked to expand the collection network across the whole country and signed agreements with 150 waste producers to deliver future roof felt waste, including production and sub-standard waste. To encourage transfer of the new technology, the project produced a good practice handbook and a brochure with guidance material for operators covering the major issues in practical operation of a collection and recycling system, including waste handling, the technical procedure for grinding roof felt into grades, transport and logistics. From an economic point of view, the recycling of roof felt as an asphalt ingredient will reduce the need of virgin hydrocarbons and this, in turn, reduces the price of the asphalt, while establishing a basis for a commercial operation. Furthermore, the developed process offers additional job opportunities compared to the current practice of burning and landfilling this waste fraction. The beneficiary has also foreseen moving the mobile machine developed in the project to new markets in neighbouring countries.","Karsten Rasmussen Holding Thisted A/S, Denmark","I/S FASAN, Denmark; Tarpaper Recycling ApS, Denmark; NKR Demolition Group A/S, Denmark; NCC Roads A/S, Denmark",Naverland 2,DK-2600,Glostrup,DK,55.6798,12.388208,,1230764400 to 1262300400,1230764400 to 1262300400,,"<a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=3275"">Project summary</a>",Sustainable Growth: Natural Resources,LIFE+,Environment & climate,"Jobs, Growth and Investment;Energy Union and Climate",1002547,2068442,DG ENV,English

Secondly, an exchange of kindergarten teachers between German and Polish institutions has taken place. This was accompanied by preparatory workshops and courses, on-the-spot support by trainers, and the development of suitable teaching material. Beyond the merely advisory support to the teachers and educators, the project has also developed products that can help non-participants improve their bilingual competences. The third aspect of the project was the development and testing of an internet platform for teachers, where they can exchange experiences, and share and discuss learning materials. Finally, the project emphasises the use of new media for teaching languages. Thus, a language learning computer programme for children was developed, which gives them the possibility to learn German or Polish.

The project had five objectives, relevant at the two levels of implementation, European and national. 1) Deepen the understanding of violence against children and young people as well as harmful practices. We will explore all forms of behaviour children or young people can suffer from, sexual abuse to bullying or practices in Scouting. This will happen at the European level by inputs of experts but equally important by the peer-to-peer exchanges. Rich of those new perspectives, the partners will explore their own reality with a new eye. 2) Offering a space for peer-to-peer learning and reflection. Peer to peer learning is very powerful as reflecting on the same activities with different point of views. It leads to unique outputs. We will facilitate it at the European level, but also at the national level, by encouraging the exchanges among national partners themselves. The collaborative platform will allow a constant exchange and facilitate the development of a community. 3) Review or create policies or tools about violence against children: some partners have already policies in place and feel that they need to review it, with the support of peers and experts. Others want to create such policies and are willing to open their process to European realities and inputs. 4) Training local leaders: Leaders are the primary link to children and young people. They are the one creating a safe environment. Their training is essential to ensure the quality of the delivery. The result of the work at the European and national levels will be to empower Scout leaders to become prevention tool themselves. 5) Spreading the knowledge, sharing the results. The project includes online collaborative platform as well as a website open to any other partner willing to contribute. The spreading of the findings, the best practices, during the whole project as well as the sharing of the final findings are key elements to allow other organisations to benefit from this project.</p>","Results The project facilitated the delivery of tailor-made policies and tools for each partner, to better answer to the needs and the specificities of each of them.

7447,,The new way to record waste transfers,Electronic Duty of Care (EDOC),,"<p>The Electronic Duty of Care (EDOC) project planned to develop a national, internet-based interface to record the collection, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials. The interface would enable monitoring and mapping of waste management without creating a mountainous paper trail. The system would also provide greater accessibility to real-time data on waste movements. This would help waste producers to track the treatment and disposal of their waste, providing more security against unauthorised activity in waste disposal.</p>",The EDOC project developed an electronic system for storing WTNs that allows information to be used to plan waste facilities and ensure compliance with legislation. It has the advantage of highlighting opportunities for minimising waste. Users of the system can also benefit from cost savings. The beneficiary estimates that the cost saving for the government could be around GDP 1 million from reducing national waste surveys alone.

7591,,Innovative plasma based transformation of food waste into high value graphitic carbon and renewable hydrogen,PlasCarb,,"<p>PlasCarb has been stimulated by a transnational consortium of R&D performing SMEs in partnership with specialist scientific resource, life cycle thinking experts, industrial customers, and access to risk finance to facilitate future market uptake. It will integrate commerce with research; transforming a widespread urban solid waste environmental problem (140 million tonnes of food and plant waste produced annually in Europe) into a sustainable source of significant economic added value, (high value graphitic carbon and renewable hydrogen). The vast majority of hydrogen and carbon used today in industry are derived from fossil petroleum sources, the majority of which are imported into the EU from regions which are often politically unstable or competitive. PlasCarb will integrate an established technology (anaerobic digestion) with innovative, low temperature microwave plasma processing and leading edge control of carbon morphology and purification. This project will extend beyond current Best Available Techniques (BAT) in the valorisation of food waste of anaerobic digestion (AD) to generate renewable energy; it will transform the biogas output from AD using an innovative low energy microwave plasma to split biogas methane into high value graphitic carbon and renewable hydrogen (RH2). The quality and economic value of the carbon and the hydrogen will then be maximised through the integration of high quality research and industrial process engineering expertise. The project will validate at a pilot scale continuous operation of the integrated process for a period of one month; 150 tonnes of mixed food waste will be digested to generate over 25,000m3 of biogas. 2,400m3 of this biogas will then be transformed into highly graphitic carbon with a market value of over EUR 2,500/tonne and RH2. A decentralised business model will be generated that can be implemented at local levels widely across Europe to facilitate future market uptake.</p>","During the first period of the project, a comprehensive year- long study was undertaken looking at the seasonal variations, composition and quality of Anaerobic Digestion (AD) biogas (methane and carbon dioxide) generated from mixed food waste this was extremely important for the next GasPlas plasma system. The GasPlas plasma system was optimised for the processing of a range of potential bio gas compositions for the formation of high value carbon materials and RH2. A new variation of the plasma nozzle has successfully been produced and subsequently verified. A range of high value carbon materials have been produced and are currently undergoing detailed analysis for their potential application across a range of different industrial applications. It is expected that the GasPlas plasma system will enable AD plant owners to increase the value of their gaseous product stream. Current AD plant financial returns are based upon the wholesale price of natural gas and/or electricity. Transforming some or all of the natural gas produced by AD plants into renewable Hydrogen and high value carbon materials will provide a significant improvement to the economics of most AD plants. A quantitative analysis and evaluation of the full sustainability, i.e. environmental, economic and social viability, of PlasCarb using the in the industry and academic accepted Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach based on ISO 14040/14044 (2006) has started. In addition an evaluation of regional and political waste management strategies from across Europe was undertaken. The main result will be to confirm the sustainability of PlasCarb in comparison to the state of the art treatment technologies. The effectiveness and the impact of the dissemination actions have been very satisfactory in the first half of the project.

7592,,Understanding the Dark Universe with 3D Weak Gravitational Lensing,DarkMatterDarkEnergy,,"<p>Understanding the twin cosmological puzzles of dark matter and dark energy remains the most fundamental challenge in modern cosmology. Almost the entire contents of the universe consist of dark matter or dark energy, but they are invisible and almost nothing is known about them. They are most effectively probed via the gravitational deflection of light from distant galaxies, a process known as ""gravitational lensing"". This is a purely geometrical effect, which is uniquely clean of astrophysical assumptions. Several dedicated gravitational lensing experiements have recently begun throughout Europe, to exploit rapid developments in telescope technology on the ground and in space. These include the VST/KIDS and Pan-Starrs surveys, as well as ESA's proposed DUNE satellite. However, measurements of gravitational lensing require the extraction of a very subtle signal, and the exploitation of such data has reached a systematic floor due to limitations in data analysis techniques. A great deal of preparation is urgently needed before the scientific potential of these funded surveys can be fully exploited. My recent work in America generated the largest ever survey from the Hubble Space Telescope. Through that experience, I have built a unique toolset that can help tap Europe's new data. I have also been deeply involved in the development of proposed American satellites SNAP and GRALE, which have very similar goals to DUNE. As a member of scientific teams on both sides of the Atlantic, I will be able to foster closer links between these complementary efforts, as well as helping to advance the project in Europe. I plan to be based at the university of Edinburgh, a centre of excellence for gravitational lensing observations, and the only institute that is a member of all three major projects. With this timely confluence of new data and analysis techniques, I would expect to make a major contribution to Europe's leadership in understanding the dark universe</p>","The standard cosmological model successfully describes an enormous range of observations using only a small number of parameters. However, profound questions about its interpretation remain unanswered. It appears that particles from the standard model of particle physics represent less than 5% of the total mass-energy content of the Universe; the rest is invisible dark matter (27%) and dark energy (68%). The origin and nature of this dark sector is still unknown, but it has shaped the evolution of the Universe. Massive structures of dark matter started growing soon after the Big Bang, and provided the scaffolding inside which were built galaxies, planets, and life. Galaxy clusters are key to understanding the dark sector. They are the densest regions of the Universe, in which gravity pulls together the different species of particles: ordinary particles from the periodic table and the exotic materials from the dark sector. If the results of the experiments carried out in this project are confirmed by my ongoing observations, this will be the first empirical evidence that dark matter has a small but non-zero interaction cross-section. While these collisions between massive galaxy clusters are providing the only constraints on the interaction cross-section of dark matter from an actual detection, their rarity has begun to limit their exploitation. I have therefore developed a new method of extending this approach to the gradual growth of all structures in the universe, which assemble through a process of small-scale mergers. I realised that each of these mergers acts as a small bullet, with the in falling dark matter and baryonic material entering large structures along slightly different trajectories. This analysis achieves a similar statistical precision to the sum of current analyses from a few large-scale collisions. However, the systematic errors are no longer limited by uncertainty in the impact velocity, impact parameter and initial velocity of individual systems – and my technique can grow in the future to almost unlimited statistical precision as the (overlap between) archives continue to grow. With an eye to the long-term future of the field, I have been coordinating between scientists and engineers to develop radiation-tolerant hardware, trying to understand its limitations and develop post-processing software that can remove the residual effects from data. This effort has been very successful so far on both fronts, and will continue of the next five to drive the mission's hardware and ground segment performance budget, and to optimize survey strategy. One immediately tangible outcome has been the application of these mitigation strategies to the Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys. My software has now been incorporated into the standard data analysis pipeline at the Space Telescope Science Institute, and is being used to enable full science exploitation of HST’s widest-field camera (which has been in orbit the longest), for all science purposes. Most excitingly, I also initiated a project at NASA to construct the balloon-borne telescope HALO, and assembled a pan-European team to join the consortium. This exploits a new technical capability for long-duration balloons that, flying above 99% of the Earth’s atmosphere, provide a platform for space-quality observations at about 1% of the cost of a dedicated space mission. The UK consortium has now delivered the mission’s guide control camera to JPL for integration, completing our hardware contribution; the first flights are scheduled for 2015, and we will also lead the data analysis. I have thus ensured European partnership in this new, balloon-platform technology that has the potential to revolutionise both astronomy and Earth-imaging applications. Finally, I have been awarded a permanent contract to work at a European University, thus achieving the final goal of the grant.",University of Durham,The University of Edinburgh is a participant,,,Durham,UK,54.7749254,-1.5697502,,1199142000 to 1388530800,1199142000 to 1388530800,,"<a href=""http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/90643_en.html"">Cordis</a>",Sustainable Growth: Natural Resources,Seventh Research framework programme (incl.

To do this the project established a dynamic gut model for the evaluation of digestive/fermentative processes and the bioavailability of active ingredients and processed food products to simulate the stomach, small intestine, ascending colon, transverse colon and descending colon. A mouth step and a dialysis step were added to allow us to examine the impact of whole foods, as they are broken down and are digested (pre-absorption) (task 1.1). A static gastrointestinal system was also developed to assess the stability and bioavailability of and the cell response to food components Additionally, the project developed an in vitro cell based platform comprising of primary assays, GI hormone secretion read-out assays and secondary assays all optimised to high throughput screening. Furthermore, an ex vivo system using biopsy samples was developed and optimised ready to test samples from artificial digestion (task 1.2). All of the components of the screening platform have been validated against a panel of pure reference ingredients provided by ingredients manufacturers in the consortium. A sampling process for the in vitro testing was also developed. A focus of WP1 has been the identification and characterisation of natural plant extracts as source ingredients with potential satiating properties (task 2.1) and a number of these have been screened on the in vitro platform Currently, the platform is being used to determine the influence of food processing and food matrix effects on the activity profile of food ingredients (task 3). WP2 has taken existing foods representative of the normal European diet and modified them with specific processing techniques (task 1) and submitted a number of these for analysis of sensory satiation and early satiety (task 2). These include: i) beverages modified by homogenization and fermentation (10), ii) meat and fish soups and balls modified by restructuring and heat treatment (13), iii) nectars, juices, cold soups modified by composition and the inclusion of natural fibres (12), iv) juice from purées and concentrates modified by homogenisation and blending (3), v) dairy products modified through fermentation and protein modification (13) and vi) breads and cereal bars modified through alterations to composition and the coating of ingredients. Approximately 80 prototypes and controls have been assessed using in vivo flavour release profiles by APcI-MS technology (satiation effects) and in vitro stomach digestion (early satiety effects; task 2). Within these products a number of satiation/satiety enhancing ingredients have been applied (task 3). Specific selection criteria for these were developed based on proven efficacy, compatibility with the food application and processing technique, anticipated mode of action, nature of matrix and usual use in the diet. WP3 has employed in vivo studies examining changes in microbiota, gut function and biomarkers of appetite to validate the in vitro screening platform (WP1), and in turn aid the selection of ingredients, foods, and changes in food structure (WP2). A set of objective biological criteria to select candidate ingredients, food matrices and changes in food structure has been completed (task 1). Short- and long-term in vitro digestion simulation studies of specific ingredients (task 2), the first short-term human dietary intervention studies (task 3) and analyses of biomarkers to assess physiological responses (task 4) are on-going.

7594,,Quantifying Weather and Climate Impacts on Health in Developing Countries,QWeCI,,"<p>One of the most dramatic and immediate impacts of climate variation is that on disease, especially the vector-borne diseases that disproportionally affect the poorest people in Africa. Although we can clearly see that, for example, an El Nino event triggers Rift Valley Fever epidemics, we remain poor at understanding why particular areas are vulnerable and how this will change in coming decades, since climate change is likely to cause entirely new global disease distributions. This applies to most vector borne disease. At the same time, we do not know currently the limit of predictability of the specific climate drivers for vector-borne disease using state-of-the-art seasonal forecast models, and how best to use these to produce skilful infection-rate predictions on seasonal timescales. The QWeCI project thus aims to understand at a more fundamental level the climate drivers of the vector-borne diseases of malaria, Rift Valley Fever, and certain tick-borne diseases, which all have major human and livestock health and economic implications in Africa, in order to assist with their short-term management and make projections of their future likely impacts. QWeCI will develop and test the methods and technology required for an integrated decision support framework for health impacts of climate and weather. Uniquely, QWeCl will bring together the best in world integrated weather/climate forecasting systems with heath impacts modelling and climate change research groups in order to build an end-to-end seamless integration of climate and weather information for the quantification and prediction of climate and weather on health impacts in Africa.</p>","An EU-funded project has taken great strides towards the modelling and monitoring of vector-borne diseases in Africa, driven by climate change. The realisation that certain disease outbreaks are closely linked with changes in climate dates back to ancient times. However, our knowledge is incomplete when it comes to how particularly vulnerable areas will be affected in coming decades. Increased accuracy of seasonal weather forecasting using state-of-the-art equipment will hopefully enable the prediction of epidemic-prone infectious diseases. The aim of the EU-funded 'Quantifying weather and climate impacts on health in developing countries' (QWECI) project was to understand why certain vector-borne diseases disproportionately affect certain parts of the world under specific climate conditions. Running in Ghana, Malawi and Senegal, the project studied how climate variation impacts on disease, especially vector-borne diseases including malaria and Rift Valley fever. The Ghana field project focused on the links between and mechanisms of malaria emergence, transmission and spread, and the role of climate change on disease variability. In Malawi, researchers collected incidence data from hospitals, and in Senegal they studied climate, water quality, vegetation, land use and veterinary aspects. Together, these studies helped generate medical databases and an atmospheric database with information about the geographical distribution of pathogens and potential climate drivers. A malaria prediction model was also created for the realistic simulation of seasonal disease patterns.

The project will provide a new, cost efficient solution to the capture, processing and display of cultural artefacts. It has been developed by a consortium of seven academic, industrial and museum partners and is being co-ordinated by researchers at Liverpool John Moores University. The project's ambition is to present artefacts, linked to their context, in an immersive display with virtual and/or with augmented reality. This virtual reality will be the ""story telling engine"" that builds the context around the objects. The project, which received EUR 2.3 million of its funding from the European Union under Horizon 2020, sets out to develop complex software to identify objects and automatically extract their meaning.</p>","Project ongoing. However, the DigiArt web platform now exists and seeks to provide a new, cost efficient solution to the capture, processing and display of cultural artefacts. It offers innovative 3D capture systems and methodologies, including aerial capture via drones, automatic registration and modelling techniques to speed up post-capture processing (which is a major bottleneck), semantic image analysis to extract features from digital 3D representations, a “story telling engine” offering a pathway to a deeper understanding of art, and also augmented/virtual reality technologies offering advanced abilities for viewing, or interacting with the 3D models. The 3D data captured by the scanners and drones, using techniques such as laser detection and ranging (LIDAR), are processed through robust features that cope with imperfect data. Semantic analysis by automatic feature extraction is used to form hyper-links between artefacts. These links are employed to connect the artefacts in what the project terms “the internet of historical things”, available anywhere, at any time, on any web-enabled device. The contextual view of art is very much enhanced by the “story telling engine” that is developed within the project. The system presents the artefact, linked to its context, in an immersive display with virtual and/or with augmented reality. Linkages and information are superimposed over the view of the item itself. The major output of the project is the toolset that will be used by museums to create such a revolutionary way of viewing and experiencing artefacts. These tools leverage the interdisciplinary skill sets of the partners to cover the complete process, namely data capture, data processing, story building, 3D visualization and 3D interaction, offering new pathways to deeper understanding of European culture. Via its three demonstration activities, the project establishes the viability of the approach in three different museum settings, offering a range of artefacts posing different challenges to the system.",DigiArt,Scladina; Museum of the Royal Tombs of Aigai; Vulcan UAV; Pix4D; Liverpool John Moores University; CERTH; CNRS,,,,UK;EL;BE;FR;CH,53.403379000000;40.567907000000;50.485586000000;43.617787000000,-2.971306000000;22.997030000000;5.026280000000;7.057558000000,,1420066800 to 1483225200,1420066800 to 1483225200,http://digiart-project.eu/,"<a href=""https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/about-us/news/a-virtual-museum"">Liverpool John Moores University's press release</a>",Smart and Inclusive Growth: Competitiveness for growth and jobs,Horizon 2020,Research & innovation,Digital Single Market,2300000,,DG RTD,English

The substance is the strongest, most impermeable and conductive material known to man. It was first discovered during ground-breaking experiments by Professors Kostya Novoselov and Andrew Geim a decade ago at the University of Manchester, for which both scientists were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2010. The European Commission has committed EUR 1 billion to the Future and Emerging Technologies (FET) Graphene Flagship project, the largest-ever research initiative funded in the history of the EU.<br />
Following the advent of graphene with its wide range of unique properties, several other one-atom-thick crystals have been isolated and their preliminary studies have been undertaken. This library of two-dimensional crystals opens a possibility to construct various 3D structures with on-demand properties, which do not exist in nature but can be assembled in Lego style by stacking individual atomic planes on top of each other in a desired sequence. This project is to explore this new avenue. </p>","We have developed a variety of advanced techniques to make artificial layered materials and devices, which are now called van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures. New methods allowing the assembly of dozens of individual atomic planes, one by one, are now available in the PI's lab.

Earth System Models are mathematical descriptions of the real world aimed at better understanding how our planet works, considering in particular the links between the oceans, vegetation, ice and desert, gases in the atmosphere, and the carbon cycle. This scope and detail make Earth System Models the primary tools for calculating the effects of future greenhouse gases emissions.</p>","CRESCENDO brings together seven Earth System Modelling (ESM) groups with three Integrated Assessment Modelling teams, as well as experts in ESM evaluation, ESM projection and feedback analysis, climate impacts and science communication to address the following goals; (i) improve the process-realism and simulation-quality of European ESMs in order to increase the reliability of future Earth system projections; (ii) develop and apply a community ESM evaluation tool allowing routine ESM performance benchmarking, process-based ESM evaluation and the analysis of Earth system projections. The resulting tool will be installed and made openly-available on the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF); (iii) further develop the discipline of emergent constraints in order to better constrain the representation of key biogeochemical and aerosol feedbacks in ESMs and thereby reduce overall uncertainty in Earth system projections; (iv) quantify the effective radiative forcing of key biogeochemical and aerosol feedbacks in ESM projections; (v) contribute to the development of a new set of combined socio-economic and climate emission scenarios that more explicitly link future socio-economic development pathways with global radiative forcing; (vi) apply the project ESMs to these new scenario data to generate an ensemble of Earth system projections for the coming century and, in combination with the underlying socio-economic scenarios, use these projections to assess joint risks and co-benefits related to climate change, climate impacts, adaptation and mitigation; (vii) ensure data produced by CRESCENDO is available to the international community through timely archival on the ESGF and work closely with climate impact assessment and regional downscaling teams to ensure maximum uptake and use of these data in such complementary areas of science; (viii) actively disseminate knowledge generated in CRESCENDO to fellow scientists, policymakers and the general public.",University of Leeds,CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE CNRSMAX-PLANCK-GESELLSCHAFT ZUR FORDERUNG DER WISSENSCHAFTEN EVFONDAZIONE CENTRO EURO-MEDITERRANEO SUI CAMBIAMENTI CLIMATICIMET OFFICETHE UNIVERSITY OF EXETERDEUTSCHES ZENTRUM FUER LUFT - UND RAUMFAHRT EV,Leeds;,,,UK;DE;FR;IT;NL;NO;SE;CH;AT;FI,53.808477800000;48.141187000000;48.847587000000;40.352638000000;52.101591000000;59.942660000000;58.582027000000;47.376550000000;48.068209000000;60.203843000000,-1.552792300000;11.581839000000;2.264082000000;18.171802000000;5.177942000000;10.720618000000;16.141311000000;8.548093000000;16.358459000000;24.961724000000,,1420066800 to 1577833200,1420066800 to 1577833200,,"<a href=""http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/196812_en.html"">Cordis</a>;<a href=""http://www.crescendoproject.eu/"">Crescendo project</a>",Sustainable Growth: Natural Resources,Environment and climate action (LIFE),Environment & climate,Energy Union and Climate,14300000,,DG RTD,English
7599,,Intelligent Systems Configuration Services for Flexible Dynamic Global Production Networks,FLEXINET,,"<p>Competitive manufacturing industry must be able to react to change and to understand the balance of possible options when making decisions on complex multi-faceted problems. Understanding how best to configure and re-configure a global production network, set against rapidly changing product-service requirements is one such complex problem area. This project aims to provide services that support the design and provision of flexible interoperable networks of production systems that can rapidly and accurately be re-configured. The metaphor employed is ‘to start with an new business idea in the morning and have all required data and networks understood by the afternoon’ To achieve this FLEXINET takes the view that new product-service global production network modelling methods and models are needed that can model business cases and identify the critical network relations and knowledge that underlies the business operation. In addition, FLEXINET takes the fundamental view that complex manufacturing systems which involve multiple partners and multiple complex network constraints, require a semantically rigorous formal foundation upon which to base the flexible re-configuration of global production networks. Based on the exploitation of these technologies, FLEXINET will deliver a set of configuration services for flexible network design, applicable to both OEMs and SMEs, that will enable ""what-if"" comparisons of costs, risks, configuration evaluations and product-service compliance requirements for alternative production network designs. FLEXINET will achieve this aim by working with its industrial partners from the industrial pump, white goods and food sectors and exploiting the world leading expertise of its partners in business modelling, business evaluation methods, risk management, manufacturing semantics, manufacturing knowledge sharing, manufacturing eco-systems, product-service systems, SME collaboration, SOA, Interoperability and standardisation.</p>","During the first reporting period the project built an understanding of how to develop its services to support user needs. Hence, the team produced three process models and use-case scenarios, for each of three companies. Developments further include a conceptual model, consisting of six main components: business environment, domain, risk, value creation, value and financial. The team produced a business rule book intended to guide business processes. Additional outcomes include definition of a model for strategic risk assessment of global production networks. The model considers dynamics and resilience of networks, allowing users to define risk scenarios and estimate losses for those scenarios. The team described a methodology for establishing tactical business models. Results describe how to accelerate the start-up of new business models, also providing a basis for analysis and assessment of the models. Additional outcomes are a defined reference ontology, whereby each of five levels draws from information in the above level and utilises it more specifically below. Applications to be supported by FLEXINET have been defined. Lastly, an approach to future testing and validation has been agreed. The FLEXINET consortium will produce tools allowing businesses to rapidly obtain information necessary for starting a new multinational venture.

7600,,"High Performance, Economical and Sustainable Biocomposite Building Materials",BioBuild,,"<p>The aim of BioBuild is to use biocomposites to reduce the embodied energy in building facade, supporting structure and internal partition systems by at least 50% over current materials with no increase in cost. This will lead to a step change in the use of sustainable, low carbon construction materials, by replacing aluminium, steel, FRP, brick and concrete in buildings. Facades are widely used in construction, primarily to protect and insulate the internal structure. Internal partitions are used to divide space, carry utilities and provide thermal and acoustic insulation. The current materials used such as aluminium, steel, brick and concrete are energy intensive to produce and have high embodied energy. FRP is an alternative construction material, benefitting from low weight, formability and simple manufacturing, allowing low material content structures and innovative design. However, typical resin and glass fibre are non-renewable, energy intensive to synthesise. Biocomposites overcome these drawbacks, whilst maintaining the benefits, being based on natural fibres and bioresins which have low embodied energy and cost. Biocomposites are renewable and sustainable resin and reinforcement structures. The resins in this project are furan and cashew nut oil based with reinforcing fibres of flax and jute. Bast fibres have lower environmental impacts than glass, concerning climate change and energy but have similar properties. Biocomposites are used commercially in automotive interior parts, but for outdoor applications they can degrade due to moisture absorption and bio-degradation. BioBuild will develop biocomposites and construction products with a life span of 40 years, by protecting the fibres with novel treatments and coatings. The result of the project will be a low cost, lightweight, durable and sustainable biocomposite building system, with full technical and environmental validation, offering low embodied energy construction materials.</p>","Consortium members selected four case studies and produced demonstrators. The BIOBUILD newsletter publicised the choice of parts, required performance, and the designs and manufacturing processes – all supported by life-cycle assessments to reduce the embodied energy of the parts. Scientists used two different resins: an unsaturated polyester with monomers partially derived from agricultural feedstocks, and a polyfurfuryl alcohol resin produced from agricultural waste rich in hemicellulose. The reinforcement was strong cellulosic fibres from the stems of flax and jute plants. To improve the sustainability and performance of their biocomposites, the BIOBUILD partners introduced a number of advances. They developed treatments and coatings to make the fibres moisture resistant and improve their adhesion to the polymer. Fire retardant additives and coatings were used to raise the flame resistance of the material, achieving EuroClass B for polyfurfuryl alcohol based laminates. The project also identified promising areas for further development work. Researchers formed an Industrial Interest Group. The contents of their meetings can be found on the project website. The project has also been widely publicised through postcards, flyers, academic papers and posters in addition to the project's newsletter. The project also exhibited at EcoBuild in London to display the new products to a wider audience. This is the leading trade fair for sustainable construction materials. On the road to success, BIOBUILD has won the 2015 JEC Innovation Award in the construction category.

7601,,Strategic Research For Innovative Marine Propulsion Concepts,STREAMLINE,,"<p>Increasing environmental concerns and soaring oil prices are creating a new focus on fuel efficiency for the marine industry. Combining low emissions with demands for more advanced vessels than ever before drives the need for radically new propulsion concepts delivering a step-change in efficiency. STREAMLINE is the response of the marine community to this demand that will be addressed through four key objectives. The first objective of STREAMLINE is to demonstrate radically new propulsion concepts delivering an increase in efficiency of at least 15% over current state-of-the-art. The concepts will be designed for maximisation of energy conversion combined with low levels of cavitation, noise and vibration. The research will look at novel applications of large area propulsion, a biomechanical system and distributed thrust (via multiple propulsors). As its second objective, STREAMLINE will investigate methods to fully optimise current SoA systems including conventional screw propeller systems, pods and waterjets. The key here is exploitation of new CFD methods to pursue improvements without dramatic vessel configuration changes. The third objective of STREAMLINE is to develop advanced CFD tools and methods to optimise the hydrodynamic performance of the new propulsion concepts, particularly by analysis of integrated hull and propulsor. Finally, STREAMLINE will characterise the operational, economic and classification aspects of each of the new propulsion concepts. STREAMLINE will demonstrate solutions for a wide range of applications. Short sea shipping and inland waterway operation will be focussed on specifically, as they are identified as key components of transport that can provide a means of coping with the growing congestion of road and rail infrastructure and tackling air pollution. The STREAMLINE consortium, led by Rolls-Royce, is made up of 30 partners from 8 Countries, providing world leading expertise and capability from the EU marine Industry.</p>","STREAMLINE has investigated three new, radically different propeller systems.The first relies on the installation of the propeller far behind the ships, so the size of the propeller can be increased dramatically while lowering its speed. The second moves large amounts of water through relatively small changes in velocity, imitating the tail of a whale as it propels itself through water. And the third comprises an array of small propellers, where water coming out of one set of propellers enhances the efficiency of the next set and so on.At the same time, the STREAMLINE team applied computational fluid dynamics tools and theoretical models to achieve higher levels of the efficiency for several currently used propellers. They also searched for ways to boost the efficiency of water jet propulsion. Despite the unparalleled performance at high speeds, a major drawback of waterjets is that for low speeds this propulsion system becomes inefficient as compared to conventional propellers. Extensive tests in the laboratory have shown that power consumption for the new propeller systems can decrease by up to 13.5 %, while the overall efficiency gains can reach 30 %. Once improvements verified in the laboratory move to the commercialisation phase, the STREAMLINE project will have a significant effect on reducing fuel consumption and polluting emissions in the not so distant future.",Rolls-Royce Power Engineering PLC.,Rolls-Royce ABWalvisstaart BVCONSIGLIO NAZIONALE DELLE RICERCHEEntwicklungszentrum fuer Schiffstechnik und Transportsysteme e.V.STICHTING MARITIEM RESEARCH INSTITUUT NEDERLANDCHALMERS TEKNISKA HOEGSKOLA ABCENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE,Derby;,,,UK;NL;IT;DE;FR;SE;NO;PL,52.9150396,-1.4661393,,1356994800 to 1388530800,1356994800 to 1388530800,http://www.streamline-project.eu/,"<a href=""http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/94118_fr.html"">Cordis</a>",Sustainable Growth: Natural Resources,Seventh Research framework programme (incl.

7602,,Neuroendocrine Immune Networks in Ageing (NINA),Neuroendocrine Immune Networks in Ageing (NINA),,"<p>Current demographic trends indicate that by the year 2020 almost 1 in 5 of the European population will be aged over 65. However, although life expectancy is increasing in the developed world, the period of good health enjoyed by its people is not keeping pace. The ageing population is thus a major health and economic issue for Europe. Although ageing is a complex process, we know much about its actions at the cellular and tissue level. In contrast, our understanding of how the various age-related changes interact to result in frailty and disease is incomplete. There is therefore a pressing need to carry out multidisciplinary research to identify factors contributing to age-related frailty and to develop interventions to promote healthy ageing. While Europe has many excellent research teams working on age-related diseases, such as neurodegeneration, there is little attempt to pool resources and identify underlying common age-related processes that predispose to pathology and represent rational targets for intervention. In addition, there is a lack of scientists trained in multidisciplinary ageing research and the challenge of an ageing population will not be met unless we increase research capacity in this area. NINA is a multi-site ITN that will make a significant impact upon research capacity by training 12 early stage researchers and 2 experienced researchers, integrating research and training at 10 world class European institutes. Fellows will benefit from the expertise of academic partners and training will be enhanced by the intersectoral experience provided by two industrial partners and a non-governmental organisation. NINA will tackle crucial health research challenges by directing the multidisciplinary programme at the identification of key factors driving the ageing process. NINA will focus on the age-related changes influencing the interactions of the brain, immune and endocrine systems to understand how these changes impact upon health.</p>","The project 'Neuroendocrine immune networks in ageing' (NINA) focused on three systems crucial for health and longevity: the central nervous system, the immune system and the endocrine system. NINA, a Marie Curie Initial Training Network (ITN), supported 15 research fellows (13 early-career and 2 experienced researchers), who studied the impact of ageing on these systems at 10 world-class institutions. Research projects investigated a range of issues related to ageing with a focus on stress. These included the effect of sleep duration and quality on the immune system; the effect of hormones secreted by adipose tissue on the immune system; the effect of the stress of caregiving on young and older adults, and the impact of early life stress on epigenetic programming. In one study with rodents, researchers found that animals with lower circulating thyroid hormones had a longer lifespan. Furthermore, these animals also were resistant to diet-induced obesity, suggesting that one secret to long life may be a more adaptable response to food intake by the hypothalamus. Other findings point to the role of stress in ageing. In rodents researchers were able to identify the early-stress response region in the promoter for the glucocorticoid receptor and how hypermethylation improved this region's response to stress. In human studies of psychological stress this was found to have a negative impact on immunity both young and older adult caregivers but was more pronounced in older adults. Researchers also found that physical activity improved sleep in older adults, a cause of stress in old age, and this should add more weight to the benefits of physical activity for healthy ageing. In another study, researchers were trying to develop ways to improve immunity in older adults and in particular how to overcome the age-related deterioration of the thymus. They experimented with ways to use stem cells to regenerate the thymus and improve responses to vaccination and showed that they could regerenate a thymus in rodents. These findings have many applications. Identifying the endocrine response to feeding early on in life may help indicate those with a more adverse response to overeating. Furthermore, simple lifestyle changes, such as increased physical activity — which leads to sounder sleep — may go a long way to promoting healthy ageing.",The University of Birmingham,"CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE CNRS,MAX-PLANCK-GESELLSCHAFT ZUR FORDERUNG DER WISSENSCHAFTEN EV,KONINKLIJKE NEDERLANDSE AKADEMIE VAN WETENSCHAPPEN - KNAW,UNIVERSIDADE DO MINHO,NORGES MILJO-OG BIOVITENSKAPLIGE UNIVERSITET,Université de L",Birmingham;,,,UK;DE;NL;PT;CH;FR;NO,52.448971700000;48.141237000000;52.371396000000;41.550858000000;46.522402000000;48.847777000000;59.666388000000,-1.930860200000;11.581871000000;4.899487000000;-8.426181000000;6.581233000000;2.264007000000;10.768024000000,,1230764400 to 1356994800,1230764400 to 1356994800,,"<a href=""http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/92673_en.html"">Cordis</a>;<a href=""http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/activity/mds/projects/ii/nina/index.aspx"">University of Birmingham</a>",Smart and Inclusive Growth: Competitiveness for growth and jobs,Seventh Research framework programme (incl.

7603,,"Plug-and-produce COmponents and METhods for cost effective, high precision manufacturing",COMET,,"<p>Yesterday’s, today’s and tomorrow’s challenging and dynamic economic environment forces European high-end manufacturing industry to focus on high flexibility, high quality, reliability and low life-cycle costs and to respond quickly to changes in this environment. The high-end manufacturing industry requests production systems that can quickly switch between diverse machining operations with short changeover, programming and set-up times without compromising quality, reliability or life-cycle costs. From a conceptual point of view, industrial robot technology could provide an excellent base for machining being both flexible (due to their lay-out) and cost efficient (robots cost 2-5 times less then machine tools). However, industrial robots lack absolute positioning accuracy (1), are unable to react in real time to changing process conditions (2) and lack reliable programming and simulation tools to ensure first time right machining once production commences (3). These three critical limitations prevent industrial robots from being integrated in high-end machining processes. The COMET consortium will provide a revolutionary Plug-and-Produce solution enabling the use of industrial robots for high end machining processes, appreciating the needs from the manufacturing industry for cost effective, flexible and reliable manufacturing solutions. The proposed solution will be on the average 30% more cost effective than dedicated machine tools whilst delivering absolute positional accuracy of at least 50 µm. Due to the sense of urgency in Europe’s manufacturing industry the COMET consortium defined an ambitious work plan of only 30 months to develop and demonstrate the innovations planned and meet the objectives set. These ambitious goals and the planned dissemination and training activities encourage a quick uptake by the manufacturing industry. Over a 5 years period, the estimated impact is 45MEUR to 50MEUR justifying the investment from the EC and the COMET partnership.</p>","COMET delivered four important techniques and technologies to enable the use of industrial robots in a plug-and-produce platform for cost-effective, reliable and flexible manufacturing. Scientists developed a methodology to extract machine-specific kinematic and dynamic models of industrial robots from every possible configuration. It employs an off-line kinematic calibration, a dynamic robot simulation with new measurements of robotic joint parameters and a novel process for force calculation. Accurate simulation of robot behaviours produces a unique signature for each robot. The robot signature is then exploited in a simulation environment that enables adaptive robot path generation. An adaptive tracking system then monitors the actual path with respect to the programmed path, using an advanced robot controller to correct deviations in real time. Finally, a high dynamics compensation mechanism (HDCM) compensates for high-frequency position errors and transients. This provides a turbo-boost to accuracy, enabling precision far beyond the capability of the robot system alone. As an example, the mean absolute error of a test piece improved from 255 micrometres with no compensation to only 32 micrometres with the HDCM. Test cases demonstrated that robot machining can significantly speed up processing compared to conventional computer-based numerical control methods.

7604,,Robotic Manipulation for Nuclear Sort and Segregation (RoMaNS),,,"<p>The RoMaNS project is helping to develop a new generation of robots to handle spent nuclear waste. Nuclear waste must be “sorted and segregated”, so that low-level waste can be placed in low-level storage containers, avoiding wastage and loss. Many older nuclear sites contain large numbers of legacy storage containers which must now be cut open, investigated, and sorted. This can only be done remotely using robots, because of the high levels of radioactive material. Current state-of-the-art practice in the industry, consists of simple tele-operation (e.g. by joystick or teach-pendant). Such an approach is not viable in the long-term, because it is prohibitively slow for processing the vast quantity of material required.

7606,,Novel X-ray Inspection System for Fast Automated Detection of Counterfeit PCB Components,ChipCheck,,"<p>Currently, electronics manufacturers do not check all PCB components at goods inwards. Some manufacturers make random checks on single components from batches of component lots. However, components especially the surface mount type are typically supplied on tape reels to assist with component feed for automatic component placement. The manufacturer cannot check all the components. Typically, a check includes visual inspection and in circuit testing. However, performing these checks is disadvantageous for two main reasons. Firstly, the tests can be time consuming and secondly it requires the component to be removed from the packaging or reel invalidating any guarantee to a claim should a counterfeit component be found. Currently, no automatic methods exist to speedily check each single component. In addition the cost of modern X-ray inspection systems prohibits their use for smaller manufacturing concerns. ChipCheck proposal is for the development of a novel X-ray inspection system for fast automated detection of counterfeit PCB components. The aim of such a development is to address the above issues. The system will be developed so that is capable of inspecting PCB components on tape reels and other component feeding mechanisms. In addition separate PCB components will also be examinable with the developed system. Through the selected combination of SME partners involved in the consortium, a new design uniquely combining lower cost off-the-shelf components used from different industries (Industrial NDT, Medical and dentistry) will be developed to enable production of a prototype of particular suitability for goods inward inspection.</p>","The innovative EU-funded CHIPCHECK project set out to deliver a low-cost X-ray inspection system to evaluate each individual component and significantly reduce the introduction of counterfeit printed circuit board (PCB) components in electronic products. Scientists employed a unique design based on lower-cost digital radiography (DR) X-ray modules used in industrial non-destructive testing and the medical and dental fields. Digital systems are more efficient than those using radiographic film, reducing exposure time for faster inspection. In addition, DR can be done in enclosed lead shield cabinets, thus reducing operator exposure. The prototype employs a remote X-ray controller housed in a metal enclosure. A mini X-ray detector was adapted from the dentistry sector to image small areas with very high resolution. An X-ray cabinet houses and integrates all parts to shield the operator from radiation. The CHIPCHECK system is capable of inspecting individual components on tape reels and other types of automated feeding systems in less than one second. Increasing influx of counterfeit electronics components from countries with minimal cultural sensitivity to or legislation to protect intellectual property rights is increasing the probability of failure of safety-critical systems. CHIPCHECK will enable inexpensive and reliable detection of counterfeit PCB components to increase safety and enhance the competitiveness of EU electronics manufacturers.

7607,,New imaging methods for detecting treatment response in lymphoma,IMAGING LYMPHOMA,,"<p>Assessing treatment response in cancer is the most important single prognostic factor for a patient. Therefore, it is crucial to detect response as early as possible during treatment. Additionally, similar tumour types frequently have markedly different responses to the same therapy. Hodgkin lymphoma, for example, is one of the tumour types where a small group of patients fail to respond or respond poorly to treatment. The early evaluation of a specific treatment allows targeting effective therapy to responding patients while sparing the non-responders from expensive, toxic and unnecessary protocols. While the current method to assess treatment response is to measure tumour shrinkage by imaging, there may exist earlier and potentially more sensitive markers of treatment response based on tumour function. Prof Brindle’s group has an established expertise in this field. This project aims to develop non-invasive and clinically applicable imaging methods for detecting the initial responses of tumors to therapy in a realistic preclinical, genetically engineered mouse model of lymphoma. In this model, tumors arise spontaneously, constituting a better model for the human disease than those used previously. We will treat these animals using current treatment protocols and will use the imaging methods that we develop to assess tumour response. These methods will include a targeted radio-labelled agent that detects dying tumour cells and a novel magnetic resonance method, based on nuclear spin hyperpolarization, in which treatment response is detected through specific changes in tumour metabolism. The best reagents and imaging protocols will be selected for use in possible future clinical trials. Although we are developing these techniques in lymphoma, they could also be used with many other tumour types. We anticipate that in the future these methods could have significant impact in the clinic, both in drug development and in tailoring treatment to individual patients.""</p>","We have developed a targeted imaging agent, based on the C2A domain of Synaptotagmin-I, which is capable of binding, with nanomolar affinity, to the phosphatidylserine exposed during tumor cell death. Our novel probe (C2Am) includes a unique cysteine residue. We labeled the cysteine residue with maleimide-DOTA and demonstrated that the 111In labeled agent was capable of detecting cell death in a murine lymphoma model. As part of our objective of developing C2Am as a clinical tool for detecting lymphoma cell death post-treatment, we undertook a systematic comparison of the performance of C2Am and Annexin V. 99mTc labeled Annexin V reached early clinical trials for detection of cell death in a variety of diseases, including lymphoma, however there were problems with its biodistribution, which limited the success of this agent in the clinic. In order to make a comparison of these agents using radionuclide imaging in vivo we obtained, during this grant period, Annexin-V modified with the HYNIC chelator, for labeling with 99mTc, and have optimized modification of C2Am with the same chelator. The success of modification was assessed using ESI mass spectrometry. With the successful implementation of FDG-PET imaging in the laboratory, the full range of radionuclide imaging techniques are now established. This allowed their systematic comparison with hyperpolarized 13C MRI techniques for detecting treatment response in lymphoma. We used the well-characterized Emu-myc transgenic mouse model, which almost invariably develops pre-B or B-cell lymphomas with associated leukemia due to constitutive expression of the c-myc oncogene in the B cell lineage under control of the Emu immunoglobulin enhancer. A remarkable observation from the studies in the Vav-driven NPM-ALK tumor model was the very high levels of labeled alanine observed in these tumors when compared to the implanted EL4 model. Interestingly these Emu-myc tumors have very low levels of alanine and are much more similar to the implanted EL4 tumor model. Quality assessment of 99mTc-labelled C2Am and Annexin V were performed using HPLC followed by cell binding assays using the EL4 lymphoma cell line. Biodistribution studies were also performed using these optimized agents, which were compared for their facility to image cell death in the implanted EL4 lymphoma model and in the new genetically engineered mouse tumor models that we have established. With the establishment of two new GEM lines, which give tumors with shorter latency periods and greater penetrance than the model used initially, with the optimization of the C2Am and Annexin V radiolabeling and with the establishment of FDG-PET in the laboratory we were ideally placed to conduct a systematic comparison of these established methods of detecting treatment response with the novel hyperpolarized 13C MRS methods of detecting treatment response that we have developed. The treatment response detected with FGD-PET imaging approach was much smaller at 24 h after cyclophosphamide treatment than the 13C MRS methods (hyperpolarized pyruvate). In the clinic, a decrease in the SUV from baseline of at least 30% after one cycle is necessary to obtain a partial response. On these grounds, a transient influx in inflammatory cells and its contribution to FDG uptake can be of importance. With clinical trials set to commence, utilization of hyperpolarized pyruvate may be preferentially used in pathologies and/or for drugs where the traditional approaches to assess treatment response tend to fail and an increased understanding of the underlying biological nature of the response seen with hyperpolarized pyruvate is required to help interpret the human data. We demonstrated the feasibility of using DNP hyperpolarized 13C-pyruvate to detect early response to cyclophosphamide treatment in a transgenic mouse of lymphoma which may complement FDG-PET as a clinical tool.",Cancer Research UK,None,,,London,UK,51.5313807,-0.1069737,,1230764400 to 1325372400,1230764400 to 1325372400,,"<a href=""http://cordis.europa.eu/projects/rcn/94931_en.html"">Cordis</a>",Smart and Inclusive Growth: Competitiveness for growth and jobs,Public health and consumer protection programme,Investment for growth,Digital Single Market,1700000,,DG RTD,English
7608,,Ecological and human health risk of antibiotics and anti-cancer drugs found in the environment,PHARMAS,,"<p>A consortium of world-class scientists from both academia and industry has been assembled to assess the risks to wild animals and humans posed by environmental exposure to pharmaceuticals. Their expertise will be supplemented by an advisory group consisting of representatives of all stakeholders. This project will concentrate on two classes of human pharmaceuticals, namely antibiotics and anti-cancer drugs, because there are good reasons for thinking that these could be of particular concern. In order to conduct sound risk assessments, including providing estimates of uncertainty, it will be necessary to obtain accurate data on both exposure concentrations and effects levels. Hence, new data on both environmental concentrations and effects on aquatic organisms will be produced during the project. The comparative sensitivities of embryos and adults will be determined, and used to reduce uncertainty in the risk assessments. The stable transformation products of the selected pharmaceuticals will also be investigated. All stakeholders and beneficiaries will be represented in the project, so that results are rapidly and reliably transferred to all interested parties. A prototype web-based classification system will be developed during the project with the intention of enabling all EU citizens to make their own informed decisions about the risk posed by human pharmaceuticals to their health and to the health of the environment. The results will able EU regulators and policy makers to make better informed decisions on the issue of pharmaceuticals in the environment.</p>","Based on the nature of the drug and the extent of potential threat, researchers focused on antibiotics and anticancer drugs. They defined possible risks for a number of PPs by taking into account scenarios of exposure, as well as the impact of the chosen PPs on organisms. Modelling was used to predict the likely concentrations of both antibiotic and anticancer drugs in European rivers and these were confirmed by actual measurements in both surface and drinking water. These PPs were toxic to aquatic organisms only at high concentrations. However, scientists found that wastewater treatment often degrades parent pharmaceuticals into sub-products that cannot be measured or assessed in terms of toxicity. Despite regional differences in the levels and exposure to environmentally released PPs, the consortium concluded that the anticancer drugs studied posed a very small threat to the environment and to human health. They formulated a risk and hazard classification system for pharmaceuticals, but emphasised the threat posed by antibiotics given their implication in antibiotic-resistant microorganisms. A European risk and hazard classification system for medicinal products is undoubtedly needed for drafting EU policies that minimise PP-associated risks for human health and ecosystems. Using the example of Sweden, PHARMAS partners are confident that by influencing existing consumption patterns through the promotion of less problematic substances, they could reduce the environmental release of toxic pharmaceuticals and their derivatives.",Brunel University London,ASSOCIATION POUR LA RECHERCHE ET LE DEVELOPPEMENT DES METHODES ET PROCESSUS INDUSTRIELS;GOETEBORGS UNIVERSITET;STICHTING KATHOLIEKE UNIVERSITEIT;IVL SVENSKA MILJOEINSTITUTET AB;LEUPHANA UNIVERSITAT LUNEBURG;NATURAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH COUNCIL;ECOLE,,,London;,UK;SE;NL;DE;FR;DK,51.5328475,-0.4728554,,1293836400 to 1388530800,1293836400 to 1388530800,,"<a href=""http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/97551_en.html"">Cordis</a>;<a href=""http://www.pharmas-eu.net/"">pharmas</a>",Sustainable Growth: Natural Resources,LIFE+,Investment for growth;Environment & climate,Energy Union and Climate,2800000,,DG RTD,English
7609,,Cardiac Death and Regeneration,CADRE,,"<p>Cardiac muscle death, unmatched by muscle cell creation, is the hallmark of acute myocardial infarction and chronic cardiomyopathies. The notion of heart failure as a muscle-cell deficiency disease has driven interest worldwide in ways to increase heart muscle cell number, by over-riding cell cycle constraints, suppressing cell death, or, most directly, cell grafting. Using stem cell antigen-1, we previously identified telomerase-expressing cells in adult mouse myocardium, which have salutary properties for bona fide cardiac regeneration. Here, we seek to address systematically the mechanisms for long-term self-renewal in Sca-1+ adult cardiac progenitor cells and in the smaller side population fraction, which is clonogenic and expresses telomerase at even higher levels. Specifically, we propose to study the roles of telomerase and of the telomere-capping protein, TRF2. Aim 1, Determine the properties of adult cardiac progenitor cells in mice that lack the RNA component of telomerase (TERC). Aim 2, Determine the properties of adult cardiac progenitor cells in mice that lack the catalytic component (TERT). To distinguish between effects of these two gene products themselves versus those that depend on cumulative telomere dysfunction, G2- and G5-null mice will be compared. Aim 3, Determine the properties of adult cardiac muscle and adult cardiac progenitor cells that lack the telomere-capping protein TRF2. Aim 4, Test the prediction that forced expression of TERT and TRF2 can augment cardiac muscle engraftment in vivo and enhance the clonal derivation of adult cardiac progenitor cells in vitro, without adversely affecting the cells differentiation potential. Work proposed in Aims 1-3 would provide indispensable fundamental information about the function of endogenous telomerase in adult cardiac progenitor cells. Conversely, work in Aim 4 would test potential therapeutic implications of telomerase and a telomere-capping protein with this auspicious population.</p>","Our studies of heart-derived Sca-1+ cardiac progenitor cells with a “side population” (SP) phenotype have helped us to develop a better understanding of their multi-lineage stem cell potential and likely involvement in the natural regenerative capacity of the heart. Our group more recently has been able to identify platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR-α) as an important cell surface feature that correlated even more precisely with the clonogenic capacity and cardiogenic transcription factor profile of the larger heterogeneous Sca-1+ population, than does the SP dye-efflux assay used previously. Systematic evaluation of the capacity of Sca-1+ SP cells has also enabled us to prove that the clonogenicity of these cells increases if cultured at lower oxygen concentration than in the hyperoxic stress of ambient oxygen, resembling better the tissue niche. This discovery emphasizes the notion that clonogenicity is an operational definition that is contingent on experimental conditions and suggests the testable hypothesis that the cells purified and cultured in this way have an increase in telomerase expression. Using quantitative telomere-specific fluorescence in situ hybridization, we have observed that cloned Sca-1+ cells that are kept in lower oxygen concentration have significantly longer telomeres. Additional characterisation of this phenomenon is currently being conducted to elucidate the mechanisms for the reduced telomere attrition and regarding telomere length maintenance. To improve understanding of the role of telomere maintenance in these cardiac progenitor cell populations and incorporate our new findings regarding the potential role of PDGFR-α as an improved prospective maker of clonogenicity, we have isolated and produced mouse heart-derived Sca-1+ PDGFR-α+ SP and non-SP cell clones, from telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) knock-out, heterozygous, and wild-type animals. Surprisingly, we observed that the absence of TERT in first generation (G1) and second generation (G2) knock-out mice does not impair the initial capacity of these cells to grow at single cell density. Whereas this feature of the cells is independent of TERT, the cell clones generated by these experiments are being characterised to understand if deletion of TERT impairs the later expansion of these cells, their propensity to undergo replicative senescence, and the susceptibility to apoptosis even in derivatives of G1 mice. We are also in the process of fully characterising the clones at the level of their telomere length, cardiogenic transcriptional signature, and telomere maintenance by the TERT-independent pathway, so-called alternative lengthening of telomeres by homologous recombination. Furthermore, we are currently characterising the susceptibility of these cell clones to undergo replicative senescence and apoptosis. We are currently testing the clonogenicity of cardiac stem cells from animals in the third generation of TERT abrogation (G3), by which stage telomere dysfunction should be evident in this genetic background. In parallel, we will compare samples from the G1, G2, and G3 TERT knockout allowing us to quantify the enzymatic activity of telomerase in different heart- derived populations of CPCs as well as terminally differentiated cells. Molecular characterisation of these novel resources will help us to understand the role of telomere maintenance in multipotent clonogenic cardiac stem cells and its contribution to the cells’ growth capacity, plasticity, and resistance to stress. Additionally, we have also successfully generated important tools for the study of the role of telomerase in cardiac progenitor cells. A key effort has been made in the generation of lentiviral vectors expressing mouse and human TERT, cloned into pLVX-IRES vectors that co-express fluorescent reporter protein, along with vectors for the mouse non-coding TERC RNA, cloned into a pLL3.8 derivative, driven by the U6 promoter and also containing a PGK-driven fluorescent protein cassette. These new tools will enable us to perform rescue experiments in in vivo and in vitro conditions.","Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine",None,London,,London,UK,51.5007339,-0.1781383,,1230764400 to 1356994800,1230764400 to 1356994800,,"<a href=""http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/89291_en.html"">Cordis</a>",Smart and Inclusive Growth: Competitiveness for growth and jobs,Public health and consumer protection programme,Investment for growth,EU as a Global Actor,2500000,,DG RTD,English

There are no known technologies for cleaning e.g. endocrine disruptors, molluscicides, acrylamide, which are major problems affecting the quality of drinking water world-wide and can degrade aquatic ecosystems. Methods based on micro- and nano-composite materials and heterogeneous catalysis with superior cleaning properties will be developed and applied to achieve efficient and environmentally friendly remediation technologies. The decontamination strategy will be further developed as a new high throughput analytical tool for monitoring trace amounts of pollutants in water. The project will tailor the structure of micro and nano-size carbon beads; nanotubes and graphene oxides to trap highly polar contaminants from water whose removal is not feasible today; embed the most effective structures in a polymeric matrix; and develop a process to decontaminate the material by means of heterogeneous catalysis where the adsorbent will act as catalyst in the degradation reaction. The carbon-based composites developed for water remediation will be optimised for use in analytical processes. The outputs of the research will contribute to the betterment of ecosystems and human health through the improvement of water treatment technologies, and science with new methodologies to trap, degrade and monitor highly polar contaminants from water. Removal and monitoring highly polar small-size molecules from water is a significant challenge and an urgent need of today.</p>","The 'Advanced methods for the removal and monitoring of polar organic contaminants' (POLARCLEAN) project began by studying new materials and methods for removing emerging polar contaminants. Then researchers used what they had learned to create ways to monitor these contaminants in the environment. Studies for scaling up the safest, most successful prototype materials have been completed. Researchers then tested the new methods against a range of polar contaminants. These included pesticides, hormones, pharmaceuticals, specific plasticisers, and nanoparticles. The properties of the materials with higher removal capacity were applied to developing tools able to detect trace contaminants. The team found that synthetic carbon materials worked better than granular activated carbon (GAC) as a water purification tool. GAC is currently used in water treatment plants. Yet, synthetic carbon outperformed GAC in the removal of metaldehyde, a particularly challenging chemical to treat. Relevant studies for scaling up the technology were carried out. Currently, synthetic carbon materials are being pilot-tested in collaboration with the water industry (United Kingdom). Furthermore, the technology was selected by the Technology Approval Group (UK) as one of the more innovative in Europe in 2012. Researchers also studied other materials. Agricultural crop by-products were assessed for possible use in water clean-up. This was the first time that natural materials have been explored for use in this way. Carbon nanoparticles were also assessed, but they proved to be less effective. The new water treatment methods have the potential to replace GAC. This change has the potential to provide water with the lowest level of pollutants possible. These carbons may also prove to be a solution to the pollution problem in ground and surface waters. It is possible that they may provide cleaner water in river basins in developing countries. It is clear that these results will have a socioeconomic impact.

7613,,Group dynamics and navigation in king penguin chicks (Aptenodytes patagonicus),PENGUINAV,,"<p>How animals make decisions in groups and coordinate their movements when travelling together has recently emerged as a hotly debated topic in behavioural science. Yet in spite of a strong theoretical framework, empirical studies of group decision-making remain limited. Here, we suggest a new model system, focusing specifically on collective decision-making during group navigation – king penguins. These birds make excellent subjects since they have both a clear tendency to group and a strong motivation to return to a specific location within the colony. We propose a series of field experiments on king penguin chicks to investigate mechanisms of group navigation and to test three central hypotheses: 1) navigational efficiency increases with group size; 2) the presence of experienced individuals affects navigational efficiency of the group; and 3) the size of navigational conflict affects the outcome of decision-making during group navigation. During the experiments, king penguin chicks will be displaced from their crèches and released in groups of different sizes and compositions. Subjects’ movements will be monitored at high spatial and temporal resolution by miniature GPS logging devices attached non-invasively to individual birds. Experimental data will be supplemented by field observations of natural crèche movements. We will use quantitative techniques developed by my host and her collaborators for an extensive and fine-grained comparative analysis of paths, and for exploring the dynamics of decisions made by individuals navigating both solo and in groups. Models of group navigation by king penguins will be developed and their outcome will be compared to the empirical data. In addition, during this project in collaboration with the Engineering Science department at Oxford, we will develop remotely detachable GPS loggers. Our results will provide important validation of the theories and new methodology for the studies of group navigation.</p>","Group decision making in animals is a hotly debated topic in behavioural science. King penguins make ideal subjects for studying this because of natural grouping behaviour and a strong motivation to find their way home. The EU-funded PENGUINAV (Group dynamics and navigation in king penguin chicks (Aptenodytes patagonicus)) project tested several hypotheses about group decision making in penguins. These were that larger group size and experience help groups navigate, and that navigational conflicts affect the outcome of group navigation. To test these hypotheses, PENGUINAV displaced groups of penguin chicks and tracked their routes back to their respective homes within the colony, known as creches. Researchers tested different size groups, as well as experienced and naive pairs of chicks. Overall, the presence of an experienced chick (one which had been displaced previously) improved group navigation. Researchers also found evidence of an optimal group size (groups of six or more usually split up), but the reason for this was not clear. Another aspect of the project used a novel time-lapse photography system called MICOBS to observe overall creche movements. Here, they saw movement to avoid predators, movement induced by changes in weather, and groups of chicks wandering in the day, without a clear purpose. The results of PENGUINAV have confirmed some hypotheses while not supporting others, showing that there is more to be learnt about group decision making. The techniques developed during PENGUINAV will help to study groups of animals in the future.","The Chancellor, Masters and Scholars of the University of Oxford",N/A,,,Oxford,UK,51.7576389,-1.2628859,,1293836400 to 1388530800,1293836400 to 1388530800,,"<a href=""http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/98730_en.html"">Cordis</a>;<a href=""http://apnesterova.wix.com/anna-p-nesterova""> Anna Pavlovna Nesterova</a>",Sustainable Growth: Natural Resources,Other preservation & management of natural resources actions & programmes,Environment & climate,Energy Union and Climate,200000,,DG RTD,English
7614,,Future Fast Aeroelastic Simulation Technologies,FFAST,,"<p>The upstream FFAST project addresses the topic Design Systems and Tools (AAT.2008.4.1.1) by developing, implementing and assessing a range of numerical simulation technologies to accelerate future aircraft design. Critical load identification methods and reduced order modelling techniques developed will potentially provide a step change in the efficiency and accuracy of the dynamic aeroelastic “loads process” . Identifying the flight conditions that lead to the maximum loads on aircraft structures and introducing higher fidelity methods at these conditions will reduce the cost and turn around time of the loads process of conventional aircraft. This will lead to significant improvements to product development and manufacture, supporting the ACARE 2020 targets. In addition, innovative designs required for green aircraft can be evaluated more rapidly and at lower risk. Reduced order modelling techniques offer the potential for further step changes in the efficiency of the aeroelastic loads process. These offer the accuracy of high fidelity methods at a cost close to that of the current low fidelity methods. The target for the FFAST project is to demonstrate a speed up of 2 to 3 orders of magnitude over high fidelity methods. To meet this target research will be carried out in work packages to: improve identification of critical loads; develop reduced order modelling strategies for unsteady aerodynamic and aeroelastic simulation. A work package dedicated to validation and evaluation on a set of industrially relevant test cases will judge the success of the technologies developed and give industry confidence to make the necessary pull-through investment. Strong industrial support of FFAST allows direct exploitation of the results via focused future investment, the solution data base and early release software. The dissemination of FFAST to a wider audience is vital and will be achieved via a website, targeted lectures and workshops, conferences and journal publications.</p>","Detailed structural models of aircraft and their components decrease the risk of design modification at a later date and reduce the need for expensive tunnel testing. Load cases due to flight manoeuvres and dynamic gusts are not known a priori. Therefore, a large number of test conditions are required to accurately capture maximum loads and assess the stresses experienced by in-service aircraft. Currently, every load calculation cycle takes more than six weeks and previous experience is of limited value in modelling new aircraft configurations without compromising safety. EU-funded scientists developed simulation technologies with better accuracy and reduced computational load through work on the project 'Future fast aeroelastic simulation technologies' (FFAST). Researchers focused on three key aspects to accelerate future aircraft design. The starting point was improved identification of the flight conditions resulting in maximum loads on aircraft structures. This was followed by extraction of reduced-order models (ROMs) of unsteady aerodynamic and aeroelastic loading from more complex full-order models. Finally, the ROMs were used to accelerate full-order calculations. The result is much higher fidelity data at a cost close to that of currently used low fidelity methods. All methods developed within the scope of FFAST provide significant computational savings compared to full-order methods. Although different methods were developed by different partners, combining these technologies will speed-up the design process by more than 90 %. The end-result would be improved ability to design greener aircraft resulting in reduced emissions with lower design costs, ensuring the competitiveness of the EU aerospace industry.",University of Bristol,Institut National de Recherche Eninformatique et Automatique; Council for Scientific and Industrial Research; Technische Universiteit Delft; Deutsches Zentrum Fuer Luft - Und Raumfahrt EV; International Research Institute for Advanced Systems; The Univers,,,Bristol;,UK;FR;ZA;NL;DE;RU;BE;IT,51.4590659,-2.6032905,,1262300400 to 1356994800,1262300400 to 1356994800,,"<a href=""http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/93282_en.html"">Cordis</a>",Smart and Inclusive Growth: Competitiveness for growth and jobs,Competitiveness and innovation framework programme (CIP),Research & innovation,"Jobs, Growth and Investment",2700000,,DG RTD,English
7615,,"Crevice-free, high reliability bi-metallic surgical instruments from shape memory alloys",CleanTools,,"<p>Flexible medical instruments such as bone reamers are currently constructed from multiple parts in dissimilar materials, which have very different properties. The current method of linking these parts together is by mechanical coupling. Effective decontamination of such instruments is challenging but is critical to avoid cross infection between patients. The geometry of the instrument assembly (particularly bone reamers and similar tools used in joint implants) have crevices at the joints which are difficult and expensive to clean and fully sterilise. Welded instruments would eliminate this problem. Approximately 7000 cases of MRSA infections were reported in UK hospitals during 2007 and similar issues are prevalent across Europe. Such infections are of particular concern in post-surgery patients. The CleanTools project aims to develop technology which will reduce this issue by making surgical instruments easier to clean and disinfect. The crevice between stainless steel cutting heads and Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) flexible shafts currently makes decontamination challenging, time consuming and chemically intensive. Additionally there have been instances of cutting heads becoming detached from the flexible drive shaft during use, causing undue implications in theatre and potential long term impacts on patient quality of life. The desirable materials for these tools, such as SMAs and stainless steels, are challenging to weld and their properties are severely degraded when they are melted in conventional welding. CleanTools will provide a method for the manufacture of surgical instruments containing SMA materials though the use of rotary friction welding (RFW). RFW is a low heat input solid phase welding technology that will preserve the properties of the materials in question. CleanTools will improve the function of flexible surgical instruments, reduce the required cleaning and disinfection effort, improve reliability and reduce the cost of manufacture within Europe.</p>","Bone reamers are used to form or enlarge holes in bone prior to insertion of prostheses. They are made of stainless steel cutting heads and shape memory alloy (SMA) flexible shafts. Mechanical coupling creates crevices that are difficult to clean and sterilise, increasing the risk of infection and, increasingly, of antibiotic-resistant infection. Welding could eliminate the crevices and contamination but the properties of stainless steel and SMAs are severely degraded when melted. To solve the problem, scientists launched the EU-funded project CLEANTOOLS. The team is exploiting rotary friction welding (RFW), a novel solid-state process that softens materials with friction heat and coalesces them with compressive force. Utilisation of RFW will require careful consideration of the materials for biocompatibility, service requirements and weld properties. In addition to legislative and literature reviews, researchers conducted experimental tests pointing to the need for an interlayer between the SMA and the stainless steel. Numerous weld trials have been conducted with the selected materials to optimise weld parameters to achieve required joint strength and ductility. Having demonstrated consistent tensile and guided bend test results, the team is now investigating commercialisation opportunities for this novel technology. CLEANTOOLS is on its way to delivering a method for producing surgical instruments with enhanced function and ease of cleaning.

7616,,Protecting space assets from high energy particles,SPACECAST,,"<p>Solar activity can trigger sporadic bursts of energetic particles and increase the number of high energy (MeV) particles trapped inside the Earth’s radiation belts. These high energy particles cause damage to satellites and are a hazard for manned spaceflight and aviation. They are difficult to predict due to uncertainties over the basic physical processes, and the need to access reliable data in real time. European space policy is committed to the Galileo radionavigation system consisting of 30 satellites, the use of space assets to protect the security of its citizens (GMES), and a strong and competitive space industry. It is therefore imperative that Europe develops the means to protect these space assets from all forms of space weather hazards, and especially now as solar activity will increase to a maximum over the next few years and will increase the hazard risk. This proposal will draw together European and international partners to increase knowledge, reduce uncertainty, and to develop a forecasting capability. We will undertake targeted studies of particle source, transport, acceleration and loss processes in the Earth’s radiation belts to improve understanding of how they respond to solar activity. We will transform research models into space weather models to forecast the radiation belts in near real time, and provide alerts for periods of high risk to stakeholders. We will test models of how solar energetic particles are accelerated by shocks in the solar wind, and are transported through the interplanetary medium, in order to improve engineering tools for predicting the intensity and fluence of solar energetic particle events. We will develop a stakeholder community for valuable feedback and deliver the results in a form accessible to the public. The project will deliver a space weather forecasting capability that will continue beyond the lifetime of the project and which will lay the foundation for an operational system.</p>","Researchers focused on three key aspects to accelerate future aircraft design.

For the first time, it is possible to forecast radiation levels for a whole range of different orbits. These range from the geostationary orbit to the slot region, including medium Earth orbit. The new system can detect and forecast high-energy particle radiation in the Earth's outer radiation belt. Using the project's two unique forecasting models, the system provides a risk index for satellite operators. One of its key features is that radiation levels are computed from the physics of wave-particle interactions. Observations had long shown that special types of very-low-frequency electromagnetic waves can increase or decrease space radiation levels. These variations are now incorporated into the forecasting models. Based on these, scientists demonstrated that chorus waves can accelerate electrons to very high energies and acceleration occurs at the geostationary orbit. In addition to detecting high-energy particles, the system is providing real-time updates of medium-energy electrons. These can statically charge a satellite, potentially damaging components such as solar panels. Previously, providing such updates had proven difficult. Finnish partners achieved this by adapting current research models to run in real time while also considering the solar wind electrical interactions with Earth's magnetosphere. During the Sun's 11-year activity cycle the number of moderate to large magnetic storms varies from about 15 to 60 per year. Solar maximum activity peaked in 2014, while in 2015 the number of magnetic storms started to wane.

7618,,Conservation Genetic Resources for Effective Species Survival,CONGRESS,,"<p>Genetic biodiversity is recognised by the Convention on Biological Diversity and the EC Biodiversity Strategy as one of three essential elements of living diversity, yet it is poorly represented at the policy level, compared to the two other components, species and ecosystems. The CONGRESS consortium aims to rectify this situation by delivering dissemination tools which policy makers and conservation managers can conveniently use to incorporate genetic biodiversity into their policy framework. The six work packages of this project fall into two components. The first component comprises WPs 1 – 5 which will provide a one-stop, community-enabled web portal, including the following components. WP1 concerns web portal design and construction. WP2 will provide databases on academics and professional end-users, publications and genetic data for key European species of conservation concern. WP3 will provide a simulation tool for biodiversity managers to assess the power of genetic data to reveal processes which may result in genetic erosion. WP4 will provide a decision matrix module to allow end-users to establish optimal policy and management options given the genetic data which have been produced. WP5 will provide a knowledge pack and information leaflets, translated into the main European languages, which can be assembled into a manual. The second component is WP6, which comprises a series of dissemination and exchange workshops carried out across the European Union, including a transborder workshop and hands-on demonstration meeting in Eastern Europe. CONGRESS will integrate and enhance these work packages by using the workshops as forums to discuss the contents of the portal and will be guided by an end-user advisory group, who will oversee the development of these tools and ensure their utility for the community who will benefit from them.</p>","A focused initiative has been applied to raise the profile of genetic diversity in line with the two other components of living diversity — species and ecosystems. To achieve this, the 'Conservation genetic resources for effective species survival' (http://www.CONGRESSgenetics.eu (CONGRESS)) project has successfully facilitated access to a huge scientific knowledge base. The major achievement of the CONGRESS consortium was the establishment of the comprehensive web portal with an attractive and user-friendly interface. The website includes a database of the genetics of threatened European wild species and a sample planning tool to assess the power of experimental design. A decision-making tool helps formulate genetic approaches to a management problem. Educational downloads include a series of 'How to' leaflets and a 'Knowledge pack' to answer management problems. The sample planning tool, renamed Sample Planning Optimisation Tool for Conservation and Population Genetics (SPOTG), is in operation and has featured in two high-profile ecology journals. Information on the 'Decision-making Tool' for end users includes explanatory text and useful links as well as connections back to the relevant management topics. The databases for the web portal feature 346 chosen species. This includes key members of large carnivores, birds including Capercaillie (an umbrella species for old growth forest, forest trees and vascular plants). Needless to say, the publications database was also a major undertaking. To measure the impact of the CONGRESS project, the user stats are telling. The web page has received over 6 000 visits since inception and the number of registered community members has risen to almost 170. SPOTG has been used 1 650 times and over 1 000 results have been viewed. It has been used in university courses and real scenarios with the black stork and large cats. Despite its complexity, 1 300 users have successfully completed the ‘Decision Making Tool’ process to formulate genetic approaches to diversity management problems. Recently, the CONGRESS team was invited to showcase the website for interested conservationists in South Africa, where a similar initiative will now be taken.

7620,,Optimal Design Tools for Ocean Energy Arrays,DTOcean,,"<p>The DTOcean project is aimed at accelerating the industrial development of ocean energy power generation knowledge, and providing design tools for deploying the first generation of wave and tidal energy converter arrays. The areas of hydrodynamic array layout, electrical infrastructure, operations, maintenance & control, moorings & foundations, and installation & logistics bring critical challenges which must be addressed for the ocean energy sector in order to reach commercialisation. Whilst the current conditions seen in the sector are acceptable for the development stage that the sector is currently primarily focussed on – testing prototype devices – they are not acceptable as the sector moves towards the deployment of medium and large-scale arrays. These factors, if not addressed, have significant consequences for the sector, such as a failure to optimise the design of ocean energy arrays due to neglecting the extra complexities of array designs over single device deployments, and failure to properly understand economic, environmental, or reliability impacts that individual components within an array design can have on the overall project. The DTOcean project brings together an integrated suite of Work Packages to address the challenges that have been highlighted, as the sector progresses from single devices to arrays. The Work Packages will form core elements of progression beyond current state-of-the-art knowledge. Within each work package there will be a significant focus on the economic, environmental and reliability challenges. This will ensure that each step of the design process considers the overall impact of individual Work Package decisions – ensuring environmentally appropriate project development.

7621,,Sensor-Base Ultrasonic Viscosity Control for the Extrusion of Recycled Plastics,Ultravisc,,"<p>Our aim is to improve processes for the recycling of post-consumer plastic waste, using new technology to compensate for impurities and variations in the physical properties of recycled feedstock. Ultravisc will allow the production of higher grade products from recycled materials, and will reduce costs for plastics recyclers and processors, thus increasing European competitiveness. It will also provide significant environmental benefits, through conservation of non-renewable raw materials, processing energy, and CO2 emissions, and a reduction in landfill use. The lack of highly efficient separation processes for consumer plastics results in materials that are contaminated and inconsistent regarding physical properties. This results in two distinct problems in the processing of these materials by extrusion methods. The first is the presence of small particulate contaminants, which can give rise to serious defects and the generation of scrap product. The second is batch-to-batch variability in the bulk melt flow index, due to differences in the source of the waste materials used. This demands re-optimisation of machine operating parameters, resulting in line downtime and materials wastage. Our process will be based on novel ‘Soft Sensor’ technology, which will monitor the viscosity of the polymer melt during processing and control the selective application of ultrasound to ensure consistent processing, using an intelligent fully closed-loop system. We will also develop an ultrasonically assisted filter pack capable of filtering fine particulate contaminants with a low back pressure, improving filtration of plastics. These innovations will enable consistent processing of variable grade recycled plastic materials.</p>","Without highly efficient methods to separate post-consumer plastic waste, feedstock exhibits significant variations in physical properties and level of contamination. Scientists successfully addressed the batch-to-batch variability in flow properties due to the aforementioned issues with EU funding of the project 'Sensor-based ultrasonic viscosity control for the extrusion of recycled plastics' (ULTRAVISC). They exploited novel soft-sensor technology that essentially uses computer algorithms to draw inferences from process observations when the use of hard sensors is not possible. Information from the soft-sensor–monitoring technology is used to control the application of ultrasound to alter the viscosity of materials in the extruder. The system also used ultrasound to aid in filtering fine particulate contaminants. Process trials with a variety of dies and both virgin and recycled feedstock demonstrated the ability of the technology to reduce viscosity, maintain desired viscosity and increase throughput. ULTRAVISC technology will enable small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to exploit the full potential of recycled plastic in the manufacture of new products. The large number of EU SMEs in the field can now continuously monitor and control the viscosity of extruded materials to minimise waste while producing higher-quality products. Better control has even opened the door to new markets, including products with thinner walls than previously possible. As consumers continue to recycle more and more plastic materials, SMEs can now take better advantage of it, increasing their competitive position while preserving natural resources.",Cherry Drainage Pipes Limited,DKI Plast A.S.; Plastitehase AS; Polinter SA; Total Sigma Measurements Ltd; The UK materials Technology Research Institute Limited; Sirris Het Collectif Centrum Van de Technologische Industrie; The Queen's University of Belfast.,,,Tullyroan;,UK;DK;EE;ES;IE;BE,54.4575923,-6.6189731,,1262300400 to 1293836400,1262300400 to 1293836400,,"<a href=""http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/107640_en.html;http://ec.europa.eu/research/infocentre/article_en.cfm?id=/research/star/index_en.cfm%3Fp%3Dss-ultravisc&item=Infocentre&artid=28294"">Cordis</a>",Smart and Inclusive Growth: Competitiveness for growth and jobs,Other preservation & management of natural resources actions & programmes,Research & innovation,Digital Single Market,900000,,DG RTD,English

7624,,Adapted Composite Repair Tooling for in-situ wind turbine blades structural rehabilitation,CORETO,,"<p>The wind turbine industry is the fastest growing market area for the use of composite materials. Current state-of-the-art turbines are increasing in size, providing multi-megawatt power output. To generate such power turbine rotorblade diameters exceeding 100m along with nacelle heights of 120m are becoming standard. As turbines grow and their deployment becomes more widespread and remote, it is becoming increasingly important that systems are put in place to monitor their condition in real time. Such monitoring offers significant cost of ownership savings through condition based maintenance, reduced downtime and a reduced likelihood of catastrophic failure. Even though important efforts have taken place lately towards condition based maintenance, there has been limited action concerning the “next step”, which should take place after the localisation of potential damage (in regards to the reparation of the blades). Existing solutions require (in most cases) the disassembly of the turbine blades and shipping to specialized composite repair facilities, which results in increased time and money requirements. Should appropriate tooling be available to enable in-situ repair of turbine blades, it is estimated that large-scale reductions could be achieved (both in terms of time and money). Within this project novel adapted tooling will be developed, which complies to wind turbine specificities and requirements (easily mounted, lightweight, fast and robust equipment) in order to enable the in-situ performance of the three major composite repair steps: Non Destructive Inspection, Surface Preparation, Hot Bonding. According to the developments of this project, which will enable in-situ repair of turbine blades for a wide variety of cases, it is estimated that large-scale reductions could be achieved both in terms of system availability and cost by minimizing the cases that require disassembly of blades and transportation to repair shop for rehabilitation.</p>","Wind turbines are an effective and sustainable way to generate energy, but the industry is handicapped by a lack of on-site monitoring and repair. Removing a turbine and transporting it for repair is a time-consuming activity that results in a productivity loss of thousands of Euros. With this in mind, the EU-funded CORETO (Adapted composite repair tooling for in-situ wind turbine blades structural rehabilitation) sought to provide a unified, on-site repair system that will drastically reduce repair time and costs associated with wind turbine damage. Work was broken down into two major activities: defect detection and repair. Project partners developed an ultrasonic scanning system to detect internal damage in wind turbine blades without the need to transport them off-site. They then optimised the system for in-situ wind turbine blade inspection. The lightweight system consists of software to control automated scanning and indicate the damage areas on a 2D/3D map with different colours. This enables inspectors to easily identify the sections where surface damage has occurred, thus cutting down on maintenance time and costs for the wind energy sector. Experiments carried out by the CORETO team on glass fibre reinforced plastics and wind turbine blades reveal that internal defects can also be detected. It took commercially available equipment commonly used in the aerospace industry and adapted it for in-situ wind turbine blade surface preparation. For the final repair, team members used a newly developed combined heating-vacuum bagging system with heating blankets designed for small and large defect areas and novel conductive heating. CORETO should deliver real productivity savings.
